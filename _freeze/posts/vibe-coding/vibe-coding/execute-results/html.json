In fact, they are downright pervasive. One of the largest challenges with LLMs today is that they are very good at coming up with plausible-sounding answers, but less good at telling us *why* or *where* they got that answer from. It's often good practice to cast a critical eye at LLM output and determine whether or not it is real or just a hallucination. These concerns have led to suggestions that we can augment a user's prompt with a set of reference documents that can be used to verify the output of the LLM, or to improve the prompt itself. For example, imagine we [wrote a prompt](https://chatgpt.com/share/67cf3c21-fd18-8007-a043-6eaec436e169) asking an LLM about [parking restrictions](https://newyork.public.law/laws/n.y._vehicle_and_traffic_law_section_1202) in New York State:\n\n> **Q:** Is it permitted to park between roadways on a highway according to New York State law?\n> **A:** According to New York State law, parking between roadways on a highway is not permitted, except where official signs indicate otherwise. Specifically, Section 1200 of the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law states that parking is prohibited in areas such as medians, between divided roadways, and other restricted zones unless otherwise posted.\n\nversus:\n\n> **Q:** Is it permitted to park between roadways on a highway according to New York State law? Review the following rules from the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law. Provide direct quotes to support your answer: *\\[full text of Vehicle & Traffic Law Section 1202\\]*\n>\n> **A:** No, it is not permitted according to New York Vehicle and Traffic Law. The law explicitly states:\n>\n> > *“No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle... in the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers, except in an emergency.”*\n>\n> This is found under Section 1(i) of the provided rules. The only exception is in the case of an emergency.\n\nThis is a bit of a contrived example, but the general idea is that we can improve the LLMs performance by providing relevant external information alongside the standard instructions. Including this extra information helps to guard against hallucinations, and also gives the user more guidance on why the LLM came to its specific answer. In the example above, the LLM is *technically* correct in the first answer that parking is not permitted - but I think it invents a rule about official signs allowing otherwise. This is probably speculation on the part of the LLM. In the prompt containing the full-text of the relevent set of rules, we obtain a shorter, cleaner response with the precise rule relevant to the question - including the citation to the exact section and subsection.\n\n### Retrieval-augmented generation\n\nThe example I've described above is essentially RAG or Retrieval-augmented generation. RAG is another one of those buzzwords that enters the conversation every time \"AI\" comes up. I wrote this blog post, in part, to demystify it for my readers (all 3 of your) and myself. When you boil down the workflow, RAG is essentially an additional step of retrieving relevant information from a database or document store before generating a response. Instead of relying solely on a model’s pre-trained knowledge, the RAG step pulls in context-specific data relevant to the question. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with rapidly changing information or domain-specific knowledge. \n\n## Coding Out a RAG Pipeline\n\nIn a [recent blog post](https://gmcirco.github.io/blog/posts/prompt-testing/prompt_testing.html) I walked through a step-by-step process of how to set up a A/B testing process for prompt refinement. I relied on data from a recent [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/295/cdc-automated-abstraction/page/917/) competition that used youth suicide narrative reports from the CDC's [National Violent Death Reporting System](https://www.cdc.gov/nvdrs/resources/nvdrsCodingManual.pdf). I was pretty happy with the workflow I built out, but couldn't help but feel that I could improve it somehow. The NVDRS has nearly 300 page coding manual with detailed instructions for each variable type. For example, section 5.5.9 describes the rules of how to code a death that is the result of a gang-related crime:\n\n> 5.5.9 Gang-related: CME/LE_GangRelated  \n> **Definition**  \n> Definitions for gang-related homicide can vary by law enforcement agency or CME and tend to capture  \n> deaths that are classified as gang-motivated (i.e., the motive of the incident was gang-related) or had  \n> suspected involvement of a gang member (i.e., a gang member was a suspect or victim in the incident).  \n> This variable captures both types of gang-related deaths reported by agencies.  \n>  \n> **Response Options**  \n> - **0** No, Not available, Unknown  \n> - **1** Yes, gang motivated  \n> - **2** Yes, suspected gang member involvement  \n> - **3** Yes, gang-related not otherwise specified  \n> - **4** Organized crime including motorcycle gangs, mafia, and drug cartels  \n\nThere are nearly a hundred such rules in this manual. However, it doesn't really make sense to try and pass the entire manual into our prompt. Even if the context window could handle the full size, when you are paying for tokens it makes sense to minimize the prompt to only the necessary bits. So what if we just wanted to augment each prompt with *only* the references that are relevant for the narrative being coded? This is where RAG comes in! \n\n### Envisioning a RAG pipeline\n\nThe way I envisioned this working was to process the RAG step separately by first indexing the relevant sub-sections from section 5 of NVDRS coding manual, which contains all information about incident circumstances. I would extract out the subsection chunks and then index them in vector database for retreval at the time of prompt creation. My prompt creator class already adds the headers, instructions, and questions to the final prompt, so all we need to add is the additional step of then tacking on the relevant rules from the vector database (see below):\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n    %% Improved node styling\n    classDef input fill:#c4e3f3,stroke:#5bc0de,stroke-width:2px,color:#31708f\n    classDef process fill:#d9edf7,stroke:#5bc0de,stroke-width:2px,color:#31708f\n    classDef database fill:#dff0d8,stroke:#5cb85c,stroke-width:2px,color:#3c763d\n    classDef output fill:#fcf8e3,stroke:#f0ad4e,stroke-width:2px,color:#8a6d3b\n    \n    %% Main components with better descriptions\n    A[\"NVDRS Manual<br/>(Source Document)\"] -->|\"Reference material\"| B\n    B[\"RAG Model<br/>(Retrieval System)\"] --> D\n    C[\"Narrative Text<br/>(Case Information)\"] -->|\"Contains: '...victim felt depressed..'\"| D\n    C --> E\n    \n    %% Database and outputs\n    D[(\"Vector Database<br/>(Knowledge Store)\")] -->|\"Retrieved: '5.3.4 Current depressed mood:'\"| F\n    E[\"Prompt Creator<br/>(Question Generator)\"] -->|\"Generates: Q1, Q2, Q3\"| F\n    \n    %% Final output\n    F[\"Final Prompt<br/>(For LLM Processing)\"]\n    \n    %% Apply styles\n    class A,C input\n    class B,E process\n    class D database\n    class F output\n\n```\n\n\nIn my mind, I figured I could come up with a quick and dirty solution by using regex to hit on key words in each narrative, and then use a semantic similarity model (like `SentenceTransformers`) to retrieve the top $n$ rules from the vector database. For example, a narrative might have a section stating:\n\n> \"Victim had been feeling **depressed** and sad in the days leading up to the incident\"\n\nUsing regex we can grab the relevant words around our matched word (here, **depressed**), encode them, and then retrieve rules from the vector database. In the last step we append these to our prompt before executing it.\n\nThere's just one problem - I've never done this before.\n\n### Vibe-Coding\n\nWhat is \"vibe coding\"? One of my favorite definitions comes from ex-OpenAI founder Andrej Karpathy:\n\n> \"There's a new kind of coding I call \"vibe coding\", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists\"\n\nIn short, it represents a programmer's full surrender to the LLM, and taking what it gives back on good faith. When problems arrive, you just dig deeper and let the LLM guide you even further down the rabbit hole, trusting the process. I think the term is very funny - but there is a bit of truth to this. \"Vibe-coding\" is sort of what I used to do early in grad school when I was trying to get some esoteric model running in R with virtually no background knowledge. To me, vibe-coding harkens back to the days of panicked copy-and-paste from a variety Stack Overflow posts.\n\nWith this in mind, I believe in sharing my work. Here's the [full conversation](https://claude.ai/share/9ae9a888-def0-4e61-96c0-6a795d5d4ad8) I used to set up the RAG framework. I had enough of an idea of what I wanted, but wanted to speed up the processing of generating code required to get the document chunking and indexing working.\n\n## Testing the RAG Process\n\nSo what did all that get us? Well, with the help of Claude we got a set of four functions that[^1]:\n\n[^1]: If you are curious about the code, you can look at my [prompt-testing repo](https://github.com/gmcirco/blog/tree/master/posts/prompt-testing/src) under my blog posts that contains the full set of classes and functions.\n\n1.  Extract the relevant pages from the coding manual.\n2.  Chunk up the pages into subsections based on headers.\n3.  Encode these chunks using a `SentenceTransformers` model.\n4.  Save the embedded chunks and the section indices in a vector database.\n\nas well as two others:\n\n5.  A function to query and retrieve results from the vector database.\n6.  A function to append the results into a prompt-friendly text object.\n\nI took the LLM-generated code and made some adjustments (maybe 10-15% or less) and then put them into their own .py file under my src folder. I then created a separate file `index_rules.py` to perform all the steps and locally store the vector database in a cache folder:\n\n::: {#96349415 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n\"Code to index rules from the NVDRS and store as vector store in cache\"\n\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader\nfrom src.rag import (\n    extract_pages,\n    chunk_by_subsections_with_codes,\n    encode_chunks,\n    create_vector_store,\n)\n\n# import the full nvdrs coding manual\n# we only need a subset of pages on circumstances\n# page 74 - 149\npage_min = 74\npage_max = 148\ncache_dir = \"cache/\"\n\nreader = PdfReader(\"reference/nvdrsCodingManual.pdf\")\n\n# extract pages, chunk subsections, then store in cache\n\npages_circumstances = extract_pages(reader, page_min, page_max)\nsection_circumstances = chunk_by_subsections_with_codes(pages_circumstances)\nsection_embeddings = encode_chunks(section_circumstances)\nindex, stored_chunks = create_vector_store(section_embeddings, cache_dir)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWith that done, the other adjustment I needed to make was to add the ability to query the vector database and return relevant coding rules based on matching key words in the narrative. What I did was set up a dict containing key words for each major question, and a query term to append to the retrieved text substring. So, for example, given a narrative like this:\n\n> \"Victim was at home and complained about feeling sad and depressed. Victim had been treated for ADHD and bipolar disorder and had reportedly not been taking his medications in the days preceeding\"\n\nWe would use a regex pattern to match 30 characters on either side of a matching keyword in the dict of keywords (one selected here below):\n\n::: {#4a4c3b5d .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nkeyterms = {\n    \"DepressedMood\": {\n        \"Terms\": [\n            \"depressed\",\n            \"depressive symptoms\",\n            \"sad\",\n            \"unhappy\",\n            \"low mood\",\n            \"feeling down\",\n            \"persistent sadness\",\n            \"major depression\",\n            \"melancholy\",\n            \"hopeless\",\n            \"despair\",\n            \"gloomy\",\n            \"emotional distress\",\n            \"tearful\",\n            \"loss of interest\",\n            \"worthlessness\",\n            \"self-loathing\",\n        ],\n        \"Query\": \"Coding rules for DepressedMood\",\n    }\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe then just loop through the dict of keywords and collect all the hits.\n\nTo illustrate: passing this example narrative into the `search_vector_database` performs the steps of searching for all regex hits, encodes the matching narrative text, and then queries it against the vector database. It then takes all of the results from the vector database search and passes these into another function that prepares it for insertion to the prompt. The `create_prompt_rules` function adds a header for the section for coding rules, and organizes them in order of section header. The code below shows a successful retreval for the `DepressedMood` variable:\n\n::: {#7a3e9d2e .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntest_narrative = \"Victim was at home and complained about feeling sad and depressed. Victim had told his partner that he was thinking about taking his own life.\"\n\nval, matched_variables = search_vector_database(test_narrative, 1, \"cache/rules_index.faiss\", \"cache/rule_chunks.pkl\")\nPROMPT_RULES = create_prompt_rules(val, matched_variables)\n\nprint(PROMPT_RULES)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nIf present, use the following rules to guide your coding of variables. Closely follow these instructions:\n    - Apply ONLY the rules relevant to the question\n    - If a rule is not relevant to the question, disregard it entirely\n    - Do NOT try and apply rules to questions where they are not closely relevant\n\n\n## RULES FOR DepressedMood:\nEvidence found: \"and complained about feeling sad and depressed. Victim had tol\"\n\nRULE 1 [Section 5.3.4]:\n5.3.4 Current depressed mood: CME/LE_DepressedMood \n \nDefinition:  \nVictim was perceived by self or others to be depressed at the time of the injury. \n \nResponse Options: \n0 No, Not Available, Unknown \n1 Yes \n \nDiscussion: \nOnly code this variable when the victim had a depressed mood at the time of injury. There does NOT \nneed to be a clinical diagnosis, and there does not need to be any indication that the depression directly \ncontributed to the death. Other words that can trigger coding this variable besides “depressed” are sad, \ndespondent, down, blue, low, unhappy, etc. Words that should not trigger coding this variable are \nagitated, angry, mad, anxious, overwrought, etc. \n \n If the victim has a known clinical history of depression but had no depressive symptoms at the time \nof the incident, this variable should NOT be selected. \n Depressed mood should not be inferred by the coder based on the circumstances (e.g., because the \nperson reports a bankruptcy); rather it must be noted in the record. \n \nManner of Death: All manners.  \n \n \n\n\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Adding it All Together\n\nNow that I had the LLM stuff mostly incorporated, all I needed to do is append this new RAG workflow to my old LLM class. I added an extra parameter named `include_rag` that triggers the RAG process and appended it to the prompt if specified by the user:\n\n::: {#6c58191d .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef standard_prompt_caching(\n        self,\n        header: str | list = None,\n        narrative: str | list = None,\n        body: str | list = None,\n        example_output: str | list = None,\n        footer: str | list = None,\n        include_rag: bool | list = False,\n        **kwargs\n    ) -> list:\n        \"\"\"Create multiple standard prompts based on all combinations of list elements.\n        This puts the narrative at the end to support OpenAI prompt caching.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # Ensure all inputs are lists for consistent iteration\n        if include_rag:\n            val, matched_variables = search_vector_database(\n                narrative,\n                2,\n                \"cache/rules_index.faiss\",\n                \"cache/rule_chunks.pkl\",\n            )\n            rag = create_prompt_rules(val, matched_variables)\n            params = [body, example_output, rag, footer, header, narrative]\n        else:\n            params = [body, example_output, footer, header, narrative]\n        param_lists = [\n            [item] if not isinstance(item, list) else item for item in params\n        ]\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe final result looks like this, which is structurally almost identical to the non-RAG version I did before. In fact, the only real change is adding `include_rag = True` to the LLM class parameters. This is all the code that processes the queries and passes them on to the OpenAI API:\n\n::: {#05327de6 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom src.prompts import HEADER1, BODY2, EXAMPLE_OUTPUT2\nfrom src.prompt_creation import Prompt\n\nclient = OpenAI()\nrun_date = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n# set up prompt\nprompt_creator = Prompt()\nROLE = \"\"\"You are a mental health expert reviewing law enforcement narratives of youth suicide incidents. \nYour task is to label variables relating to the incident.

The V had a gunshot wound to the right side of the head and no exit was noted. Medics arrived and took over life saving efforts. Per the V's fiance the V suffered form anxiety and depression. The V's mood had been changing all day as he was approaching the 1 year marker of his high school friend dying by suicide. The V had been drinking throughout the day and at 2000 hours hours the V went to the park. The V was not allowed to have firearms. Prior to shooting himself the V said \"you don't think I'll do it.\" The V was transported to the hospital where he died. The firearm used was .22 caliber and a note was found that appeared to have been written by a child that read \"I love mom and dad.\" There were several gummy bears rolled up in a plastic bag with #9 written on it and a small zip lock bag with pink powder inside. There were several bottles of alcohol, THC oil and cigarette butts in the bathroom.

Note can be written or electronic. \n \nResponse Options: \n0 No, Not Available, Unknown \n1 Yes \n \nDiscussion: \n A will or folder of financial papers near the victim does not constitute a suicide note. \n \nSection 5. Circumstances  131 | Page  \n   \n If the record states the person left a note, you can infer it was a suicide note in the absence of \ninformation indicating that the note had some other purpose. \n A suicide note can be any essentially durable message; it does not have to be on a piece of paper. \nEmails, text messages, voice mail, or writing on any object (such as a wall or table) all qualify. Phone \ncalls do not qualify, as they are not considered durable (even 911 calls, because the decedent may \nor may not have known they were being recorded). \n A suicide note does not have to communicate that the person wants or intends to die. Notes that \nare written to warn others at the scene of the fatal injury that conditions may be hazardous or \ndisturbing may be included (e.g., “Call 911, do not enter garage” or “Carbon monoxide – do not \nenter”).  \n A text or electronic message sent right before the suicide occurred should be labeled a suicide note, \nif there was no time between the sending/receipt of the message and the suicide. If there was time \nto intervene, this should be coded as “disclosed suicidal thought or intent.” If the contents of the \nsuicide note are included or described in your source documents, summarizing this information in \nthe narrative is helpful to provide further context for the incident. If you choose to do so, do not \ninclude verbatim text and do not include identifying information, but a summary of what was said. \nThis information may be helpful in noting themes related to the suicide that go beyond standard \nNVDRS circumstances and are one of the only means of accessing the decedents’ thoughts about \ntheir suicide more directly. \n \nManner of Death: Suicide and undetermined deaths. \n \n \n\n\nRULE 2 [Section 5.7.4]:\n5.7.4 Recent Disclosed Suicidal Thoughts or Intent to Die by Suicide: \nCME/LE_SuicideIntentDisclosed \n \nDefinition: Victim disclosed to another person their thoughts and/or plans to die by suicide within the \nlast month. Disclosure of suicidal thoughts or plan can be verbal, written or electronic. \n \nResponse Options: \n0 No, Not Available, Unknown \n1 Yes \n \nDiscussion:  \nThis variable helps identifies suicides for which opportunities to intervene and prevent the death may \nhave been present near the time of the suicide. It is also useful for exploring the association between \nstated intent and actual death. \n \n Code as “Yes” if the victim had disclosed suicidal thoughts or plans to another person recently or \nwithin the last month, whether explicitly (e.g., “I have been thinking about suicide lately” or “I plan \nto go to my cabin with my gun and never come back”) or indirectly (e.g., “I know how to put a \npermanent end to this pain”). Include in the narrative any available details about whom the intent \nwas disclosed to, how long before the death the intent was disclosed, and what was said during the \ndisclosure. \n Code as “Yes” if there was opportunity to intervene between the time the person disclosed intent \nand the injury event. \no Do not code this variable if the victim disclosed the intention to kill him or herself only at the \nmoment of the suicide (i.e., when there was no opportunity to intervene to stop the \nsuicide). For instance, sending an email or text message right before the victim shot herself. \nThis would be considered a suicide note. \n Do not endorse this variable if the victim had talked about suicide sometime in the distant past but \nhad not recently disclosed a current intent to die by suicide to anyone. This would be coded as \n“History of disclosed suicidal thoughts/plans”. \n A separate suicide attempt by the victim within a month of the suicide should be coded as “Yes.” In \nthis case, “History of suicide attempts” should also be coded, “Yes.” \n The timing of when the victim disclosed the suicidal intent may be unclear (e.g., recently or some \ntime ago) or not mentioned. Please use the following rules to code these cases: \no Code “Yes” if the narrative states the victim “just” or “recently” told someone about his \nsuicidal intent. \no If the record indicates disclosure of intent, but is unclear about the timeframe (i.e., does not \nmention it all), code as “Yes.” \no LE or C/ME reports may be unclear about timing of the disclosure. If the record indicates \ndisclosure of intent in the past, but states that there was no disclosure for the current \nincident, do not code, instead use the “History of suicidal thoughts/plan/attempts.” \no If the victim disclosed suicidal intent “a long time ago,” “more than a month ago,” or in the \n \nSection 5.

However, do not code this \ncircumstance based only on a positive toxicology test for psychiatric medications (such as \nantidepressants). There must also be some indication that the victim was actually being treated for a \nmental health condition, such as a current prescription, the report of a family member, etc. \n  \nAlso code: At least one Mental Health Diagnosis variable should also be coded if this is coded.

EMS arrived and declared the V dead at the scene. The V had recently broken up with his girlfriend and was very depressed the evening before, the V's roommate was concerned the V was suicidal. The ex-girlfriend stated she was speaking with the V on the phone and he made suicidal statements to her, while talking to the V the ex-girlfriend heard a loud noise in the background and the phone went dead, she then contacted 911. Police were contacted and they made a welfare check and was unable to reach the V at his residence. While speaking to the V's roommate the police started to search on a wooded path behind his residence. A handwritten note was discovered, it appeared to be a suicide note. The v was located hanging from one of the trees just off path.The V, a XX XX, died from asphyxia due to hanging.  The decedent was found during a welfare check requested by his ex-girlfriend.  The ex-girlfriend reported he had called her and told her \"he was going to kill himself\" and then she heard a loud noise.  She arrived at his home and his gun was missing so she assumed he shot himself.  He was found in the woods behind his home hanging from a tree.  A suicide note was found in the home.  The mother reported he suffered from depression, ADHD, PTSD, school problems and legal problems.  The mother reported an undiagnosed and untreated PTSD.  The decedent had witnessed his friend shot in front of him.  Since then he had \"gone down the wrong path\".  He struggled with alcohol and drugs.  The mother reported he was trying to turn his life around after the birth of his child, but was denied visitation rights due to his legal troubles.\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\nAnd the output:\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>JSON Output</summary>\n\n::: {#b69d22be .cell execution_count=8}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n{\n    \"DepressedMood\": 1,\n    \"MentalIllnessTreatmentCurrnt\": 0,\n    \"HistoryMentalIllnessTreatmnt\": 1,\n    \"SuicideAttemptHistory\": 0,\n    \"SuicideThoughtHistory\": 1,\n    \"SubstanceAbuseProblem\": 1,\n    \"MentalHealthProblem\": 1,\n    \"DiagnosisAnxiety\": 0,\n    \"DiagnosisDepressionDysthymia\": 1,\n    \"DiagnosisBipolar\": 0,\n    \"DiagnosisAdhd\": 1,\n    \"IntimatePartnerProblem\": 1,\n    \"FamilyRelationship\": 0,\n    \"Argument\": 0,\n    \"SchoolProblem\": 0,\n    \"RecentCriminalLegalProblem\": 1,\n    \"SuicideNote\": 1,\n    \"SuicideIntentDisclosed\": 1,\n    \"DisclosedToIntimatePartner\": 1,\n    \"DisclosedToOtherFamilyMember\": 0,\n    \"DisclosedToFriend\": 0,\n    \"InjuryLocationType\": 3,\n    \"WeaponType1\": 6\n}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\nI didn't ask for any reasoning or citations for the rules provided. Here I just wanted the raw JSON output - but it would be trivial to add another section and ask for specific citations when the rules provided were applied. Looking at the retrieval part I am actually quite surprised how well it was able to pull the relevant rules based on keyword hits.\n\n## My Take\n\nTo be honest, I was surprised that most of the Claude-generated code worked as well as it did. I had to make few substantial changes. The code to do the chunking, embedding, and indexing took maybe under 30 minutes for me to read through, edit slightly, and execute. Adding these functions into my existing workflow took under and hour - so maybe 90 minutes total from prompt to working RAG proof-of-concept. To be honest, totally wild. I could have figured this out on my own, but this was like half a day of work, compared to the week it would take me to do it solely by scratch.\n\nHere's the rub - I think \"vibe coding\" can be helpful to jump start a project from nothing to a workable proof-of-concept. I do NOT think it is a good idea to rely 100% on AI-generated code without knowing what it is actually doing. Personally, I think its a good idea to get a working POC and then pick apart all of the functions and steps the LLM generated to understand whats happening. Blind coding can certainly be a \"vibe\" but I don't think it is sustainable for real-world production-level code.\n\n",
