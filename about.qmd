## Who Am I?

I'm Gio Circo, a Ph.D. in criminology and former assistant professor. I currently
work at Gainwell technologies as a data scientist. My work primarily focuses on
causal inference, Bayesian statistics, and anomaly detection. 

I'm big into food, wine, and spirits - especially cocktails.
