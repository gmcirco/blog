## Who Am I?

I'm Gio Circo, a Ph.D. in criminology and former assistant professor. I currently work at Gainwell Technologies as a data scientist. My work at Gainwell focuses primarily on models for payment integrity (fraud detection, and anomaly detection), synthetic data generation, and deep learning models for insurance subrogation.

Outside of work I love running, cooking, making cocktails, and drinking wine.
