<section id="llms-and-rag" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="llms-and-rag">LLMs and RAG</h2>
<p>For most people who are up-to-date in tech, large language models (LLMs) are nothing new. In fact, they are downright pervasive. One of the largest challenges with LLMs today is that they are very good at coming up with plausible-sounding answers, but less good at telling us <em>why</em> or <em>where</em> they got that answer from. It’s often good practice to cast a critical eye at LLM output and determine whether or not it is real or just a hallucination. These concerns have led to suggestions that we can augment a user’s prompt with a set of reference documents that can be used to verify the output of the LLM, or to improve the prompt itself. For example, imagine we <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67cf3c21-fd18-8007-a043-6eaec436e169">wrote a prompt</a> asking an LLM about <a href="https://newyork.public.law/laws/n.y._vehicle_and_traffic_law_section_1202">parking restrictions</a> in New York State:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it permitted to park between roadways on a highway according to New York State law? <strong>A:</strong> According to New York State law, parking between roadways on a highway is not permitted, except where official signs indicate otherwise. Specifically, Section 1200 of the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law states that parking is prohibited in areas such as medians, between divided roadways, and other restricted zones unless otherwise posted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>versus:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it permitted to park between roadways on a highway according to New York State law? Review the following rules from the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law. Provide direct quotes to support your answer: <em>[full text of Vehicle &amp; Traffic Law Section 1202]</em></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No, it is not permitted according to New York Vehicle and Traffic Law. The law explicitly states:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle… in the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers, except in an emergency.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is found under Section 1(i) of the provided rules. The only exception is in the case of an emergency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a bit of a contrived example, but the general idea is that we can improve the LLMs performance by providing relevant external information alongside the standard instructions. Including this extra information helps to guard against hallucinations, and also gives the user more guidance on why the LLM came to its specific answer. In the example above, the LLM is <em>technically</em> correct in the first answer that parking is not permitted - but I think it invents a rule about official signs allowing otherwise. This is probably speculation on the part of the LLM. In the prompt containing the full-text of the relevent set of rules, we obtain a shorter, cleaner response with the precise rule relevant to the question - including the citation to the exact section and subsection.</p>
<section id="retrieval-augmented-generation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retrieval-augmented-generation">Retrieval-augmented generation</h3>
<p>The example I’ve described above is essentially RAG or Retrieval-augmented generation. RAG is another one of those buzzwords that enters the conversation every time “AI” comes up. I wrote this blog post, in part, to demystify it for my readers (all 3 of your) and myself. When you boil down the workflow, RAG is essentially an additional step of retrieving relevant information from a database or document store before generating a response. Instead of relying solely on a model’s pre-trained knowledge, the RAG step pulls in context-specific data relevant to the question. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with rapidly changing information or domain-specific knowledge.</p>

<section id="coding-out-a-rag-pipeline" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coding-out-a-rag-pipeline">Coding Out a RAG Pipeline</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://gmcirco.github.io/blog/posts/prompt-testing/prompt_testing.html">recent blog post</a> I walked through a step-by-step process of how to set up a A/B testing process for prompt refinement. I relied on data from a recent <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/295/cdc-automated-abstraction/page/917/">DrivenData</a> competition that used youth suicide narrative reports from the CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nvdrs/resources/nvdrsCodingManual.pdf">National Violent Death Reporting System</a>. I was pretty happy with the workflow I built out, but couldn’t help but feel that I could improve it somehow. The NVDRS has nearly 300 page coding manual with detailed instructions for each variable type. For example, section 5.5.9 describes the rules of how to code a death that is the result of a gang-related crime:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>5.5.9 Gang-related: CME/LE_GangRelated<br>
<strong>Definition</strong><br>
Definitions for gang-related homicide can vary by law enforcement agency or CME and tend to capture<br>
deaths that are classified as gang-motivated (i.e., the motive of the incident was gang-related) or had<br>
suspected involvement of a gang member (i.e., a gang member was a suspect or victim in the incident).<br>
This variable captures both types of gang-related deaths reported by agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Response Options</strong><br>
- <strong>0</strong> No, Not available, Unknown<br>
- <strong>1</strong> Yes, gang motivated<br>
- <strong>2</strong> Yes, suspected gang member involvement<br>
- <strong>3</strong> Yes, gang-related not otherwise specified<br>
- <strong>4</strong> Organized crime including motorcycle gangs, mafia, and drug cartels</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are nearly a hundred such rules in this manual. However, it doesn’t really make sense to try and pass the entire manual into our prompt. Even if the context window could handle the full size, when you are paying for tokens it makes sense to minimize the prompt to only the necessary bits. So what if we just wanted to augment each prompt with <em>only</em> the references that are relevant for the narrative being coded? This is where RAG comes in!</p>
<section id="envisioning-a-rag-pipeline" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="envisioning-a-rag-pipeline">Envisioning a RAG pipeline</h3>
<p>The way I envisioned this working was to process the RAG step separately by first indexing the relevant sub-sections from section 5 of NVDRS coding manual, which contains all information about incident circumstances. I would extract out the subsection chunks and then index them in vector database for retreval at the time of prompt creation. My prompt creator class already adds the headers, instructions, and questions to the final prompt, so all we need to add is the additional step of then tacking on the relevant rules from the vector database (see below):</p>

<p>In my mind, I figured I could come up with a quick and dirty solution by using regex to hit on key words in each narrative, and then use a semantic similarity model (like <code>SentenceTransformers</code>) to retrieve the top <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> rules from the vector database. For example, a narrative might have a section stating:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Victim had been feeling <strong>depressed</strong> and sad in the days leading up to the incident”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using regex we can grab the relevant words around our matched word (here, <strong>depressed</strong>), encode them, and then retrieve rules from the vector database. In the last step we append these to our prompt before executing it.</p>
<p>There’s just one problem - I’ve never done this before.</p>
</section>
<section id="vibe-coding" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vibe-coding">Vibe-Coding</h3>
<p>What is “vibe coding”? One of my favorite definitions comes from ex-OpenAI founder Andrej Karpathy:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“There’s a new kind of coding I call”vibe coding”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, it represents a programmer’s full surrender to the LLM, and taking what it gives back on good faith. When problems arrive, you just dig deeper and let the LLM guide you even further down the rabbit hole, trusting the process. I think the term is very funny - but there is a bit of truth to this. “Vibe-coding” is sort of what I used to do early in grad school when I was trying to get some esoteric model running in R with virtually no background knowledge. To me, vibe-coding harkens back to the days of panicked copy-and-paste from a variety Stack Overflow posts.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I believe in sharing my work. Here’s the <a href="https://claude.ai/share/9ae9a888-def0-4e61-96c0-6a795d5d4ad8">full conversation</a> I used to set up the RAG framework. I had enough of an idea of what I wanted, but wanted to speed up the processing of generating code required to get the document chunking and indexing working.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="testing-the-rag-process" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="testing-the-rag-process">Testing the RAG Process</h2>
<p>So what did all that get us? Well, with the help of Claude we got a set of four functions that<sup>1</sup>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Extract the relevant pages from the coding manual.</li>
<li>Chunk up the pages into subsections based on headers.</li>
<li>Encode these chunks using a <code>SentenceTransformers</code> model.</li>
<li>Save the embedded chunks and the section indices in a vector database.</li>
</ol>
<p>as well as two others:</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>A function to query and retrieve results from the vector database.</li>
<li>A function to append the results into a prompt-friendly text object.</li>
</ol>
<p>I took the LLM-generated code and made some adjustments (maybe 10-15% or less) and then put them into their own .py file under my src folder. I then created a separate file <code>index_rules.py</code> to perform all the steps and locally store the vector database in a cache folder:</p>

<p>With that done, the other adjustment I needed to make was to add the ability to query the vector database and return relevant coding rules based on matching key words in the narrative. What I did was set up a dict containing key words for each major question, and a query term to append to the retrieved text substring. So, for example, given a narrative like this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Victim was at home and complained about feeling sad and depressed. Victim had been treated for ADHD and bipolar disorder and had reportedly not been taking his medications in the days preceeding”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We would use a regex pattern to match 30 characters on either side of a matching keyword in the dict of keywords (one selected here below):</p>

<p>We then just loop through the dict of keywords and collect all the hits.</p>
<p>To illustrate: passing this example narrative into the <code>search_vector_database</code> performs the steps of searching for all regex hits, encodes the matching narrative text, and then queries it against the vector database. It then takes all of the results from the vector database search and passes these into another function that prepares it for insertion to the prompt. The <code>create_prompt_rules</code> function adds a header for the section for coding rules, and organizes them in order of section header.

## RULES FOR DepressedMood:
Evidence found: "and complained about feeling sad and depressed. Victim had tol"

RULE 1 [Section 5.3.4]:
5.3.4 Current depressed mood: CME/LE_DepressedMood 
 
Definition:  
Victim was perceived by self or others to be depressed at the time of the injury. 
 
Response Options: 
0 No, Not Available, Unknown 
1 Yes 
 
Discussion: 
Only code this variable when the victim had a depressed mood at the time of injury. There does NOT 
need to be a clinical diagnosis, and there does not need to be any indication that the depression directly 
contributed to the death. Other words that can trigger coding this variable besides “depressed” are sad, 
despondent, down, blue, low, unhappy, etc. Words that should not trigger coding this variable are 
agitated, angry, mad, anxious, overwrought, etc. 
 
 If the victim has a known clinical history of depression but had no depressive symptoms at the time 
of the incident, this variable should NOT be selected. 
 Depressed mood should not be inferred by the coder based on the circumstances (e.g., because the 
person reports a bankruptcy); rather it must be noted in the record. 
 
Manner of Death: All manners.

If present, use the following rules to guide your coding of variables. Closely follow these instructions:
    - Apply ONLY the rules relevant to the question
    - If a rule is not relevant to the question, disregard it entirely
    - Do NOT try and apply rules to questions where they are not closely relevant


## RULES FOR SuicideNote:
Evidence found: "scovered, it appeared to be a suicide note. The v was located hanging fr", "home hanging from a tree.  A suicide note was found in the home.  The m"

RULE 1 [Section 5.7.6]:
5.7.6 Left a suicide note: CME/LE_SuicideNote 
 
Definition: 
Victim left a suicide note (or other recorded communication). Note can be written or electronic. 
 
Response Options: 
0 No, Not Available, Unknown 
1 Yes 
 
Discussion: 
 A will or folder of financial papers near the victim does not constitute a suicide note. 
 
Section 5. Circumstances  131 | Page  
   
 If the record states the person left a note, you can infer it was a suicide note in the absence of 
information indicating that the note had some other purpose. 
 A suicide note can be any essentially durable message; it does not have to be on a piece of paper. 
Emails, text messages, voice mail, or writing on any object (such as a wall or table) all qualify. Phone 
calls do not qualify, as they are not considered durable (even 911 calls, because the decedent may 
or may not have known they were being recorded). 
 A suicide note does not have to communicate that the person wants or intends to die. Notes that 
are written to warn others at the scene of the fatal injury that conditions may be hazardous or 
disturbing may be included (e.g., “Call 911, do not enter garage” or “Carbon monoxide – do not 
enter”).  
 A text or electronic message sent right before the suicide occurred should be labeled a suicide note, 
if there was no time between the sending/receipt of the message and the suicide. If there was time 
to intervene, this should be coded as “disclosed suicidal thought or intent.” If the contents of the 
suicide note are included or described in your source documents, summarizing this information in 
the narrative is helpful to provide further context for the incident. If you choose to do so, do not 
include verbatim text and do not include identifying information, but a summary of what was said. 
This information may be helpful in noting themes related to the suicide that go beyond standard 
NVDRS circumstances and are one of the only means of accessing the decedents’ thoughts about 
their suicide more directly. 
 
Manner of Death: Suicide and undetermined deaths. 
 
 


RULE 2 [Section 5.7.4]:
5.7.4 Recent Disclosed Suicidal Thoughts or Intent to Die by Suicide: 
CME/LE_SuicideIntentDisclosed 
 
Definition: Victim disclosed to another person their thoughts and/or plans to die by suicide within the 
last month. Disclosure of suicidal thoughts or plan can be verbal, written or electronic. 
 
Response Options: 
0 No, Not Available, Unknown 
1 Yes 
 
Discussion:  
This variable helps identifies suicides for which opportunities to intervene and prevent the death may 
have been present near the time of the suicide. It is also useful for exploring the association between 
stated intent and actual death. 
 
 Code as “Yes” if the victim had disclosed suicidal thoughts or plans to another person recently or 
within the last month, whether explicitly (e.g., “I have been thinking about suicide lately” or “I plan 
to go to my cabin with my gun and never come back”) or indirectly (e.g., “I know how to put a 
permanent end to this pain”). Include in the narrative any available details about whom the intent 
was disclosed to, how long before the death the intent was disclosed, and what was said during the 
disclosure. 
 Code as “Yes” if there was opportunity to intervene between the time the person disclosed intent 
and the injury event. 
o Do not code this variable if the victim disclosed the intention to kill him or herself only at the 
moment of the suicide (i.e., when there was no opportunity to intervene to stop the 
suicide). For instance, sending an email or text message right before the victim shot herself. 
This would be considered a suicide note. 
 Do not endorse this variable if the victim had talked about suicide sometime in the distant past but 
had not recently disclosed a current intent to die by suicide to anyone. This would be coded as 
“History of disclosed suicidal thoughts/plans”. 
 A separate suicide attempt by the victim within a month of the suicide should be coded as “Yes.” In 
this case, “History of suicide attempts” should also be coded, “Yes.” 
 The timing of when the victim disclosed the suicidal intent may be unclear (e.g., recently or some 
time ago) or not mentioned. Please use the following rules to code these cases: 
o Code “Yes” if the narrative states the victim “just” or “recently” told someone about his 
suicidal intent. 
o If the record indicates disclosure of intent, but is unclear about the timeframe (i.e., does not 
mention it all), code as “Yes.” 
o LE or C/ME reports may be unclear about timing of the disclosure. If the record indicates 
disclosure of intent in the past, but states that there was no disclosure for the current 
incident, do not code, instead use the “History of suicidal thoughts/plan/attempts.” 
o If the victim disclosed suicidal intent “a long time ago,” “more than a month ago,” or in the 
 
Section 5. Circumstances  130 | Page  
   
“past,” code as “No” and code “History of disclosed suicidal thought/plans/actions.” 
 
Manner of Death: Suicide and undetermined deaths.  
 
 




## RULES FOR DiagnosisAnxiety:
Evidence found: "ffered from depression, ADHD, PTSD, school problems and legal pr", "an undiagnosed and untreated PTSD.  The decedent had witnessed"

RULE 1 [Section 5.3.3]:
5.3.3 Mental Health Diagnosis Variables 
5.3.3.1. Mental health diagnosis 1: CME/LE_MentalHealthDiagnosis1 
5.3.3.2. Mental health diagnosis 2: CME/LE_MentalHealthDiagnosis2

66 Other (specify in diagnosis text), including personality disorders, etc. 
88 Not applicable 
99 Unknown 
 
 CME/LE_MentalHealthDiagnosisOther  
Text 
 
Discussion:  
This variable indicates the nature of the victim’s mental health problem (the diagnosis), if available. 
 
 Code up to two diagnoses and then write in additional diagnoses (i.e., three or more diagnoses) in 
the “MentalHealthDiagnosisOther” field. When using the “MentalHealthDiagnosisOther” field, 
please separate diagnoses with a comma (e.g., antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic 
personality disorder). 
 For cases in which the victim was noted as being treated for a mental health problem, but the actual 
diagnosis is not documented, code “MentalHealthDiagnosis1” as “Unknown.” 
 
Section 5. Circumstances  82 | Page  
   
 If a diagnosis is not on the code list, code “Other” and record the diagnosis in the text field, 
“MentalHealthDiagnosisOther.” 
 Do not attempt to infer a diagnosis based on reading the symptoms. 
 While it is acceptable to endorse “Mental health problem” based on the victim’s prescription for a 
psychiatric medication, please do not infer or code a specific mental health diagnosis based on the 
medication. 
 Please note that bipolar disorder may be referred to as “manic depression” or similar terms (e.g., 
“manic depressive”) in source documents. While these are outdated terms, please code these cases 
as “2 – Bipolar Disorder.” 
 Obsessive compulsive disorder may be referred to as “OCD” in source documents. Please code these 
cases as “8 – Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.” 
 Post-traumatic stress disorder may be referred to as “PTSD” in source documents. Please code these 
cases as “5 – Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.”  
 
Manner of Death: All manners.  
 
 


RULE 2 [Section 5.3.1]:
5.3.1 Current diagnosed mental health problem: CME/LE_MentalHealthProblem 
 
Definition:  
Current mental health problem 
 
Response Options: 
0 No, Not Available, Unknown 
1 Yes 
 
Discussion: 
Code a victim as “Yes” for “C/ME/LE_MentalHealthProblem” if he or she has been identified as currently 
having a mental health problem. There does not need to be any indication that the mental health 
condition directly contributed to the death. 
 
 Mental health problems include those disorders and syndromes listed in the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) with the exception of alcohol and other 
substance dependence (as these are captured in separate variables). 
 Examples of disorders qualifying as mental health problems include diagnoses such as major 
depression, schizophrenia, and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as neurodevelopmental 
disorders (such as intellectual disability, autism, attention-deficit /hyperactivity disorder), eating 
disorders, personality disorders, and organic mental disorders (such as Alzheimer’s and other 
dementias). 
 Also indicate “Yes” if it is mentioned in the source document that the victim was being treated for a 
mental health problem, even if the nature of the problem is unclear (e.g., “was being treated for 
various psychiatric problems”). 
 It is acceptable to endorse this variable on the basis of past treatment of a mental health problem, 
unless it is specifically noted that the past problem has been resolved. However, do not code this 
circumstance based only on a positive toxicology test for psychiatric medications (such as 
antidepressants). There must also be some indication that the victim was actually being treated for a 
mental health condition, such as a current prescription, the report of a family member, etc. 
  
Also code: At least one Mental Health Diagnosis variable should also be coded if this is coded. If the type 
of mental health diagnosis is unknown, please code “Type of first mental illness diagnosed” as “99 –
Unknown.”  
 
Manner of Death: All manners.

Discussion:  
This variable indicates the nature of the victim’s mental health problem (the diagnosis), if available. 
 
 Code up to two diagnoses and then write in additional diagnoses (i.e., three or more diagnoses) in 
the “MentalHealthDiagnosisOther” field. When using the “MentalHealthDiagnosisOther” field, 
please separate diagnoses with a comma (e.g., antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic 
personality disorder). 
 For cases in which the victim was noted as being treated for a mental health problem, but the actual 
diagnosis is not documented, code “MentalHealthDiagnosis1” as “Unknown.” 
 
Section 5. Circumstances  82 | Page  
   
 If a diagnosis is not on the code list, code “Other” and record the diagnosis in the text field, 
“MentalHealthDiagnosisOther.” 
 Do not attempt to infer a diagnosis based on reading the symptoms. 
 While it is acceptable to endorse “Mental health problem” based on the victim’s prescription for a 
psychiatric medication, please do not infer or code a specific mental health diagnosis based on the 
medication. 
 Please note that bipolar disorder may be referred to as “manic depression” or similar terms (e.g., 
“manic depressive”) in source documents. While these are outdated terms, please code these cases 
as “2 – Bipolar Disorder.” 
 Obsessive compulsive disorder may be referred to as “OCD” in source documents. Please code these 
cases as “8 – Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.” 
 Post-traumatic stress disorder may be referred to as “PTSD” in source documents. Please code these 
cases as “5 – Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.”  
 
Manner of Death: All manners.  
 
 


RULE 2 [Section 5.1.2]:
5.1.2 Coding Mental Health, Alcohol and Substance Abuse Problems 
Abstractors should code circumstances related to mental health, alcohol or substance abuse problems, 
or other addictions as “Yes” if any of these problems are indicated in investigation reports. A direct link 
to the death is not required. These circumstances are coded for all victims. 
 
 




## RULES FOR DepressedMood:
Evidence found: "h his girlfriend and was very depressed the evening before, the V's r"

RULE 1 [Section 5.3.4]:
5.3.4 Current depressed mood: CME/LE_DepressedMood 
 
Definition:  
Victim was perceived by self or others to be depressed at the time of the injury. 
 
Response Options: 
0 No, Not Available, Unknown 
1 Yes 
 
Discussion: 
Only code this variable when the victim had a depressed mood at the time of injury. There does NOT 
need to be a clinical diagnosis, and there does not need to be any indication that the depression directly 
contributed to the death. Other words that can trigger coding this variable besides “depressed” are sad, 
despondent, down, blue, low, unhappy, etc. Words that should not trigger coding this variable are 
agitated, angry, mad, anxious, overwrought, etc. 
 
 If the victim has a known clinical history of depression but had no depressive symptoms at the time 
of the incident, this variable should NOT be selected. 
 Depressed mood should not be inferred by the coder based on the circumstances (e.g., because the 
person reports a bankruptcy); rather it must be noted in the record. 
 
Manner of Death: All manners.  
 
 


RULE 2 [Section 5.7.1]:
5.7.1 History of suicidal thoughts or plans: CME/LE_SuicideThoughtHistory 
 
Definition:  
Victim had a history of suicidal thoughts or plans. Disclosure of suicidal thoughts or plan can be verbal, 
written or electronic. 
 
Response Options: 
0 No, Not Available, Unknown 
1 Yes 
 
Discussion:  
Use this code for victims who have at any time in their life expressed suicidal thoughts or plans. The 
victim may or may not have disclosed suicidal thoughts and/or plans close to the time of the suicide. 
 
 Suicidal ideation can be expressed directly (e.g., “I am thinking of killing myself”) or indirectly (e.g., “I 
don’t know if I want to go on living”). 
 When the timing is unclear (e.g., timing not mentioned) or if the suicidal thoughts were described as 
occurring in the “past,” “a few years ago,” or “just,” history of suicidal thoughts should be “Yes.” 
 Also code “Recently disclosed suicidal thoughts/plans” in addition to this item, if the victim disclosed 
suicidal thoughts and/or plans close to the time (within one month) of the suicide.”   
 Code “No” for previous suicide attempts if the victim did not disclose suicidal thoughts or plans. 
Previous suicide attempts should be coded as “History of Suicide Attempts.” 
 
Note: This variable was added in August 2013.  
 
Manner of Death: Suicide and undetermined deaths.  
 
 



Carefully read the following law enforcement narrative:
The V, an XX XX, was discovered by police hanging in a wooded area, 911 was called. EMS arrived and declared the V dead at the scene. The V had recently broken up with his girlfriend and was very depressed the evening before, the V's roommate was concerned the V was suicidal. The ex-girlfriend stated she was speaking with the V on the phone and he made suicidal statements to her, while talking to the V the ex-girlfriend heard a loud noise in the background and the phone went dead, she then contacted 911. Police were contacted and they made a welfare check and was unable to reach the V at his residence. While speaking to the V's roommate the police started to search on a wooded path behind his residence. A handwritten note was discovered, it appeared to be a suicide note. The v was located hanging from one of the trees just off path.The V, a XX XX, died from asphyxia due to hanging.  The decedent was found during a welfare check requested by his ex-girlfriend.  The ex-girlfriend reported he had called her and told her "he was going to kill himself" and then she heard a loud noise.  She arrived at his home and his gun was missing so she assumed he shot himself.  He was found in the woods behind his home hanging from a tree.  A suicide note was found in the home.  The mother reported he suffered from depression, ADHD, PTSD, school problems and legal problems.  The mother reported an undiagnosed and untreated PTSD.  The decedent had witnessed his friend shot in front of him.  Since then he had "gone down the wrong path".  He struggled with alcohol and drugs.  The mother reported he was trying to turn his life around after the birth of his child, but was denied visitation rights due to his legal troubles.

<p>I didn’t ask for any reasoning or citations for the rules provided. Here I just wanted the raw JSON output - but it would be trivial to add another section and ask for specific citations when the rules provided were applied. Looking at the retrieval part I am actually quite surprised how well it was able to pull the relevant rules based on keyword hits.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-take">My Take</h2>
<p>To be honest, I was surprised that most of the Claude-generated code worked as well as it did. I had to make few substantial changes. The code to do the chunking, embedding, and indexing took maybe under 30 minutes for me to read through, edit slightly, and execute. Adding these functions into my existing workflow took under and hour - so maybe 90 minutes total from prompt to working RAG proof-of-concept. To be honest, totally wild. I could have figured this out on my own, but this was like half a day of work, compared to the week it would take me to do it solely by scratch.</p>
<p>Here’s the rub - I think “vibe coding” can be helpful to jump start a project from nothing to a workable proof-of-concept. I do NOT think it is a good idea to rely 100% on AI-generated code without knowing what it is actually doing. Personally, I think its a good idea to get a working POC and then pick apart all of the functions and steps the LLM generated to understand whats happening. Blind coding can certainly be a “vibe” but I don’t think it is sustainable for real-world production-level code.</p>

  <title>Finding Fake Traffic Tickets in CT State Police Data</title>
  <dc:creator>Gio Circo, Ph.D.</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="fake-tickets-galore" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fake-tickets-galore">Fake Tickets Galore</h2>
<p>In 2022 news broke that Connecticut State Police officers had been likely submitting tens of thousands of fake traffic tickets. What started from a <a href="https://www.ctinsider.com/news/article/CT-troopers-fabricated-tickets-17393339.php">report by CT Insider</a> about 4 officers expanded to an audit that implicated dozens more officers in the scandal.</p>
<p>Before I start, this is more of an academic exercise. I actually think the approach that the folks who did the audit is probably the best way and simplest way. In their case they found fake tickets by counting up the number of stops which didn’t have a matching citation in the system. For this example we’re going to rely only on the raw data which is publically available.</p>
</section>
<section id="working-on-the-outside" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-on-the-outside">Working on the outside</h2>
<p>My hypothesis for the fake ticketing was that officers wanted to quickly pad their activity logs with fake stops. Because creating a stop log requires filling out a standardized form, I assumed that these officers would do it as quickly and as lazily as possible. I can imagine this looking like an officer at the end of their shift padding out activity with a bunch of zero-effort fake stops. Relying on this hunch, I figured I could detect unusual officer behavior by finding those whose distribution of stop times looked much different than the average officer. Humans are actually <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0041531">quite bad</a> at generating “random” numbers. In order to pad out a shift, there would probably be a lot of stops with very short times.</p>
<section id="the-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-data">The Data</h3>
<p>The data for this comes from Connecticut’s <a href="http://trafficstops.ctdata.org/">Racial Profiling Prohibition Project</a> data portal. These contain data on all traffic stops conducted by local and state police, which have information on the time, date, reason for the stop, and some basic demographic information on the driver. For this analysis I use the data from 2018, and focus on unique stops involving only officers from the Connecticut State Police.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, the publicly available data doesn’t directly disclose the length of the stop. There is a variable <code>InterventionDurationCode</code> which only reports the length of the stop between 3 bins: <code>(0-15, 16-30, 30+)</code>. For my purposes this is far too coarse of a measure to distinguish abnormal stop lengths. However, as an analog, I figured I could instead compute the time interval <em>between</em> stops. That is, the interval in time between when one stop begins and the next stop begins. This gives us an indirect way of measuring how long a stop took before the next stop was initiated:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?interval=%20time_%7Bstop2%7D%20-%20time_%7Bstop_1%7D"></p>
<p>So if we had two stops, with one at <code>16:31:31</code> and one at <code>16:40:15</code>, the <em>interval</em> would be about 8.7 minutes. As an example, this would look like:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>          ID       Troop Violation_Type       Date     Time Duration Interval
1 1000001884 CSP Troop E  STC Violation 2018-01-07 16:31:31     &lt;NA&gt;       NA
2 1000001884 CSP Troop E  Speed Related 2018-01-07 16:40:15 524 secs 8.733333</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

</section>
<section id="results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h2>
<p>To start, it makes sense to first evaluate what “average” stop length intervals look like. One way of doing this is just a bunch of density plots for each officer. Here we’re looking at the top 100 officers by number of stops for 2018. The dark line here is the average for all 100 officers. We can see that the majority of stop intervals are between 10 and 20 minutes, with a long tail reaching out to our maximum of 1 hour. This makes sense, because most traffic stops are pretty perfunctory: warning drivers that a tail light is out, writing a ticket for speeding, etc…). However, a small number of traffic stops are more complex and might involve searches, DWI investigations, or require another officer to attend. Regardless, this plot below gives us some idea of the “average” stop time, as well as the individual behaviors of different officers.</p>

<p>But I think an easier way to visualize this is to transform the distribution above to the <em>empirical cumulative density function</em> (ECDF) for each officer. The ECDF is actually a very useful tool for this kind of question because it makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data. Simply put, and ECDF reports the proportion of observations at or below each given interval between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B0,1%5D">. All we do is report the cumulative value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/n"> for each of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> data points in a distribution. This is closely related to the quantile. Such that the ECDF at 0.5 is equivalent to the median.</p>
<p>The plot below shows the distribution of stop time intervals for all intervals between 0 and 60 minutes. The dark line is the average for all 100 officers, and the light colored lines are the individual officers’ ECDFs. Below we see that the median interval between stops is about 18 minutes. As we expect officer stop intervals are mostly randomly distributed above and below this. What we are actually interested in are officers whose ECDFs are unusually shorter compared to everyone else.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="officer-88185785">Officer “88185785”</h3>
<p>This officer had the shortest average interval between stops at 14.2 minutes. In fact, more than half of their stops were at intervals of 10 minutes or less. This feels incredibly fast if you consider how long it takes to pull someone over. It seems implausible that this person was conducting almost non-stop traffic stops, taking driver information, issuing a warning (I assume?), and then getting <em>another</em> stop almost immediately afterwards.</p>

<p><em>There are synthesized depictions of self-harm and suicide in this blog post.</em></p>
<section id="whats-up-with-prompts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-up-with-prompts">What’s up with Prompts?</h2>
<p>I am still a relative novice to large-language models (LLMs) when it comes to non-trivial tasks (like asking ChatGPT to summarize an email). Applying these models for complex real-world tasks is not nearly as simple. In fact, I think applying LLMs to solve business-problems is still new enough that I am not sure how many people can claim bonda-fide expertise here. Regardless, in my work I’ve been increasingly asked to use LLMs to automate the processing of large volumes of free-form text and extract structured output. Luckily, this is one task that LLMs are actually well-suited for, unlike many of the very silly attempts to plug it in where it is clearly <em>not</em> useful.</p>
<p>In my ongoing work, I have learned a few things. One of the biggest is that LLMs are <em>very</em> sensitive to the prompt they are given. Often, it can be a matter of wording, question structure, or even where the prompt is <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/long-context-tips">placed relative to the input</a>. A few of the LLM companies, like Anthropic, even have some interesting suggestions: like structuring long documents with XML tagging to block off important sections. Outside of some of these more esoteric suggestions, I’ve found that common good practice for creating LLM prompts generally follows these rules:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Be <em>extremely</em> specific</li>
<li>Spell out tasks using bullets or numbered points</li>
<li>Provide examples</li>
</ol>
<p>This could be as simple as the difference between:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Summarize this legal document”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Summarize this housing contract in 3 to 5 sentences. Include a section with numbered bullet points for the costs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One gives much more latitude to the LLM to do whatever it thinks is right, compared to the other which has structure and key instructions. Generally you will get better results the less you let the LLM fill in the blanks on its own.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-up-a-testing-framework">Setting up a testing framework</h2>
<p>With that in mind, let’s talk a bit about how I think about prompting.</p>
<section id="my-mental-model-of-prompting" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-mental-model-of-prompting">My “mental model” of prompting</h3>
<p>When I think of a prompt, I tend to conceptualize it as containing a few key pieces:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A <strong>role</strong> which defines the key tasks of the LLM and provides it some structure to its intended job.</li>
<li>A <strong>header</strong> which contains some initial instructions guiding the next steps in the prompt.</li>
<li>A <strong>body</strong> which has the bulk of the instructions, text, and other materials that make up the primary tasks of the prompt.</li>
<li>An <strong>example</strong> of what the intended output is supposed to look like. In a structured text extraction task, this would be the format of the json or other file I want created.</li>
<li>An optional <strong>footer</strong> that contains some final instructions. Often times I have found these useful to provide a list of things I definitively do NOT want the LLM to do.</li>
</ol>

<section id="a-python-framework" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-python-framework">A python framework</h3>
<p>Applying this to an automated workflow in python can be pretty easily actually. Since we’re just working with text prompts, all I need to do is create a system that concats all the necessary pieces together in a way that creates a full prompt. Below I set up a class to help test multiple prompt versions in a somewhat quicker fashion than creating each one individually. My goal here is to have the ability to test many different prompts, in different configurations, without having to manually copy-and-paste these examples and store them. To accomplish this, I first built out a small prompt creation class:</p>

<p>All this class really does is take text strings and pastes them together using my mental framework. The trick here is that you can pass in a list for any of the parameters, and then we use <code>itertools.product()</code> to create all the possible combinations. For example, passing in 2 versions of a header, body, and example would give you <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%5E3=8"> different combinations of the prompts. Also, here I add a “narrative” field which will serve as the input text for each text narrative we will be extracting data from.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classifying-youth-suicide-narratives">Classifying Youth Suicide Narratives</h2>
<p>The example problem here is based on a competition that was hosted by the CDC last year on <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/295/cdc-automated-abstraction/">DrivenData</a>. The stated goal of the contest was to extract structured information from free-text narratives derived from police and medical examiner reports. The free text reports look something like this simulated example below:</p>
<p><em>[Simulated Example]</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>V was a YYYY. V was discovered deceased at home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. No medical history was documented in the report. According to V’s close friend and coworker, V had struggled with periods of severe anxiety but had never spoken about self-harm. V’s friend mentioned that several years ago, V had driven recklessly after a personal loss, but it was unclear whether it was an intentional act. On the night of the incident, V had been drinking and sent a message to a relative expressing regret and affection for them and other family members. Toxicology results confirmed the presence of alcohol. No additional details regarding the event were available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contest required taking the short narratives and extracting 24 different variables based on definitions from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nvdrs/resources/nvdrscodingmanual.pdf?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nvdrs/nvdrsCodingManual.pdf">national violent death reporting system</a>. Most of these are <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/295/cdc-automated-abstraction/page/917/">binary indicators</a> about specific behaviors observed in the narrative. Therefore, we need to create a prompt that will instruct our LLM to read the narratives, extract features based on the rules for each of the 24 features, then return the output back to us in a format that we can use for scoring.</p>
<section id="prompt-creation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prompt-creation">Prompt creation</h3>
<p>As a demonstration of what this testing can look like, my idea is to run 4 different prompt versions using a sample of narratives and evaluate whether we can observe any improvement in performance based solely on the prompt. As a default the body and example output of my primary prompt looks like this:</p>

<p>This prompt is basically a copy-paste from the instructions in the contest, with an example json object to ensure the LLM knows what to output. This is probably the absolute minimum you would need to get some useful output. That being said, there are at least two areas I think we can improve this baseline prompt:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add detailed descriptions to each feature</li>
<li>Add “few shot” examples</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one will have us spell out a bit more closely what we actually mean for each variable. For example we might turn this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>DepressedMood: The person was perceived to be depressed at the time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>into this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>DepressedMood: The person was perceived to be depressed at the time - 1: Specific signs of depression were noted in the narrative (e.g., sad, withdrawn, hopeless) - 0: No mention of depressive symptoms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first one is vague, and gives the LLM a lot of freedom to guess what “perceived to be depressed” means. In contrast, the second one asks only to mark it if there were specific mentions of depresion noted in the narrative.</p>
<p>We can also add “few shot” examples to the prompt. This just means we provide the LLM with a few examples of a narrative and output to give it a better idea of what we want. Here is a synthesized example of what this might look like using a simulated narrative:</p>

<p>If you want to see all of the propmpt versions, you can look at the script under <code>src.prompts.py</code> in the git repo for this post.</p>

<section id="running-through-chatgpt" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="running-through-chatgpt">Running through ChatGPT</h3>
<p>To test all variants of these prompts, I took a sample of 200 cases from the 4000 original narratives, and oversampled from rare categories to ensure I had at least a few examples for each variable (if you are curious, you can look at my <code>uid_weighting.R</code> script for how I did this). Using these 200 cases, I wanted to test the 4 different prompt types by running them through a ChatGPT LLM. Most of the work is handled using the code below, where I take each sample narrative, construct 4 prompts, then append them to a json request template. All of these 200 examples are appended into a jsonlist object, then bulk run in a batch using the OpenAI API. I use one of the cheaper models here, <code>4.0 mini</code>, which is probably fine for testing purposes. I should also note that tokens are <em>cheap</em>. In a batch run with 1.7 million tokens, I paid 13 cents for the input tokens and 6 cents for the output tokens. I actually messed up the prompt caching for this test, but if I did it correctly it would be 50% cheaper.</p>
<p>One important note - I specify the output must come in the form of a json object by adding <code>"response_format": { "type": "json_object" }</code>. This is ChatGPT’s “json mode”, which is quite handy for this. Oftentimes the LLM might hallucinate an output that is not a valid json and break the workflow.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h2>
<p>To evaluate the results we use the same <a href="https://github.com/drivendataorg/youth-mental-health-runtime/blob/main/src/scoring.py">metrics provided by the contest</a>: a macro-weighted f1 score for the binary variables, and a micro-weighted f1 score for the multi-class categorical variables.</p>
<p>Below we see that relative to the baseline prompt (model 0) adding descriptions and adding examples had a positive impact on both the f1 score and accuracy in the aggregate. The model with the highest score was the one with both detailed variable descriptions and 3 scored examples. Overall, all of the models did pretty well given how little tweaking I did. The more interesting question is looking at how much quality really was impacted by different prompting styles relative to the general randomness we typically expect out of an LLM.</p>

<p>A solution: remember analysis of variance from your stats 101 course? We can actually use it here to see if there if there is non-zero variation in f1 score attributable to a change in prompts, relative to the variation in question type. Looking below we see, unsurprisingly, almost all the variation is explainable by the question type (meaning that differences in f1 scores are mostly based on the question type).</p>

<p>If we break this down by question type and plot them out, the results are a bit clearer. Below I have the questions ordered based on their variance in f1 scores, so that questions that changed more often based on the prompt are nearer the top. Interestingly, a few questions see a large improvement from the baseline prompt to the more advanced one. <code>DepressedMood</code> has an f1 score of .5 on the original prompt, which increases to about .65 on the final prompt. We see similar results with <code>SchoolProblem</code>, <code>FamilyRelationship</code>, and <code>Argument</code> as well. Questions that were already doing quite good see virtually no change - like <code>WeaponType1</code>. The LLM has a very easy time identifying the weapon, because it is almost always clearly disclosed in the narrative (and is very often a firearm).</p>

<p>To wrap up this very long blog post, I have a few things to note:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Writing good prompts isn’t hard - but requires structuring questions in a way to ensure you get what you expect to see.</li>
<li>Setting up a testing environment can help automate comparisons of many different prompts.</li>
<li>Principled testing can help reduce manual prompt testing down the road.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re still in uncharted waters, comparatively speaking. Things on the LLM front are moving fast!</p>

<section id="retrieve-and-rerank" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retrieve-and-rerank">Retrieve and rerank</h3>
<p>The logic behind the “<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00473/110994/Retrieve-Fast-Rerank-Smart-Cooperative-and-Joint">retrieve and rerank</a>” method is that we have two sets of tools that excel at one specific task. Specifically we want to use a combination of a bi-encoder and cross-encoder to retrieve data based on an initial input query. The trade-off we have to deal with is that cross-enocder models are very slow, while bi-encoder models have performance that often falls short for retreval purposes.</p>
<p>The bi-encoder model (the “retrieve” part) creates seperate embeddings of the input query and corpus text and looks for the closest match based on the vector space. This is often done by finding the nearest cosine similarity. The retreval step is typically quite fast, with the trade-off that some information is lost because the query and search corpus are embedded seperately.</p>
<p>On the flip side, a cross encoder embeds the search query and corpus together. The major advantage of this, is that the cross-encoder uses cross-attention to create the similarity score, which pools information about the both inputs directly. However, the major trade off is that this requires the search query to be embedded with every query-corpus pair. In a very large dataset, this might create millions of pairs and is can be potentially very slow.</p>

<p>Therefore, it makes sense to use both of these methods in tandem. We can quickly retrieve the top 100 or so records using the bi-encoder, then re-rank the retrieved records using the bi-encoder. This way we limit the number of paired records we have to run through it.</p>
<p>To do this in Python I create a <code>RetrieveReranker</code> class. The class is initialized with a bi-encoder and cross-encoder model, and a corpus of text to serve as the searchable data base. Most of the important work is handled by the <code>query</code> function, which takes an input query string, creates an embedding, then retrieves the 100 most similar documents based on cosine similarity. These 100 records are then passed to the bi-encoder which re-ranks them and returns the most similar ones.</p>
<p>I should note, this is a pretty limited first attempt at “off-the-shelf” pre-trained models. I’m not doing any pre-training, nor am I doing any fine-tuning here. It’s quite clear that both would strongly improve performance, but this is too simple of an example to warrant the effort.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-a-records-retrieval-model">Creating A Records Retrieval Model</h2>
<p>Now that we have our class defined, we can import it below and utilize it. In order for it to work we need to pass in both a bi-encoder and a cross-encoder model. Recall, the bi-encoder will do the first pass to get the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> most similar records, then pass these to the cross-encoder. Hence, the “retrieve and rerank” method. Below, we use <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/modernbert">ModernBERT</a> in tandem with a <a href="https://www.sbert.net/">SentenceTransformers</a> model to do the embedding and first pass as the bi-encoder, and a <a href="https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2">MS Macro</a> model as the cross encoder.</p>
<p>Now, ideally we would fine-tune the cross-encoder model so that input queries would more closely match the medical narratives. This would have the added benefit of improvement performance for asymmeterical queries (e.g.&nbsp;providing a short query to retrieve a much longer text). But right now we can rely on out-of-the box performance as a demonstration.</p>
<p>Our corpus is relatively small. We take a sample of 50,000 records from the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/cgibin/NEISSQuery/home.aspx">2022 NEISS</a> dataset and use some local functions to clean up the NEISS text entries a bit before we pass them into the model. From these narratives we pass them through a SentenceTransformer model using ModernBert to embed them as a 50000x768 dimension array. Essentially this a fancy method of data compression, where we extract and store semantic meaning from the narratives as a vector of numeric values.</p>

<p>Now that we’re ready, we can encode the corpus using the pre-defined models by passing it all into our <code>RetrieveReranker</code> class. Passing the corpus_path argument allows us to save the embeddings as a pickle file and reload it when it exists so we don’t have to go through the very time consuming process of re-embedding the corpus each time we do this. Without using a GPU embedding 50,000 narratives takes around 30-40 minutes.</p>

<p>After that has processed we’re ready to query our corpus with an example text string. Let’s imagine we had a case involving an elderly fall at an elderly care facility (ECF) and we wanted to find 5 similar cases based on information provided in the narrative:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="asymmetrical-queries">Asymmetrical queries</h3>
<p>Given we have done zero fine tuning on either the embedding model or the cross encoder, the results are are pretty good. However, a notable weakness of this current approach is that the model is not robust for asymmetrical queries - that is, queries which are much shorter than the optimal one in the corpus. For example, let’s say we just wanted to find a case where an elderly person fell in a bathtub. Here I just type in a manual example:</p>

<p>The results here are ok (they give us cases involving slip and falls in a bathtub) but we’ll note they are similarly short to the input query. For example, here is another narrative involving an elderly fall in the bathtub, but it is ranked much lower because its length and structure are asymmetrical to the input:</p>

<p>“75YOM PT HAULING FIREWOOD 3 WKS AGO; DEVELOPED BACK PAIN. 2 NIGHTS AGO SLIPPED &amp; FELL IN BATHTUB, COULDLN’T GET UP UNTIL MORNING WITH NEIGHBOR’S HELP DX: LOW BACK PAIN, SHINGLES, ELEVATED LIVER FUNCTION TESTS #”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is because the retreveal model matches close to queries with similar lengths. In the case of a true querying model, we need to map questions to positive and negative inputs. Fine-tuning the cross-encoder could help improve this, although it is a time-consuming process. What I wanted to demonstrate here is not a “true” RAG search model, but more of a semantic search and retreval model. In the latter approach the model expects to see a more context-rich example to use for document retreval.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="revisiting-the-2024-election">Revisiting the 2024 Election</h2>
<p>The 2024 election is over. Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris by about 2 million popular votes and 86 electoral votes. All the posturing, forecasting, and <a href="https://polymarket.com/elections">betting</a> is over. So why am I posting about the election now?</p>
<p>Well, at the outset of the election I became interesting in running my own forecasting model. Nowadays there are plenty of folks running their own forecasting models - from individual bloggers to big news agencies like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-president.html">New York Times</a>. Poll aggregation is one of those things that is very “Bayesian” and I learned a lot about it reading through various books. To boot, I’ve always been a big fan of Andrew Gelman, as well as some other folks who do election and public policy forecasting - like <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/">Nate Silver</a> and <a href="https://gelliottmorris.com/">Elliot Morris</a>. So I thought, “what the hell” and threw my hat into the ring. I held off on posting this because I figured there was already enough noise out there about the election, and maybe the world didn’t need one more person adding to the cacophony.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-model">My Model</h2>
<p>To keep it simple, I focused on the simplest kind of model - a poll aggregation model estimating national vote for the two-party candidates. This approach avoids a lot of additional complexity of estimating electoral college votes by not having to model state-level vote share, correlations between states, and many other things. This was truly just meant for a bit of academic fun. As a source of data, I used the very nicely curated tables supplied by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/national/">538 here</a>, which was continuously updated during the election cycle. Helpfully, this data contains some other useful variables such as information about pollsters, and 538’s own ranking of pollster’s reliability.</p>
<p>For my model I applied filtering to get a subset of polls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only polls that included a Trump-Harris match up</li>
<li>Polls that were conducted just before Biden dropped out (6/1/2024)</li>
<li>Only polls including likely voters, registered voters, or adults</li>
<li>Removed overlapping polls</li>
<li>Polls with larger than 5,000 respondents</li>
</ul>
<p>Dropping polls with more than 5,000 respondents is largely an approach to remove pollsters who “dredge” for lots of responses that are often typically of low quality. In total, this leaves us with about 255 unique polls in the 165 days between 6/1/2024 and 11/4/2024.</p>
<section id="the-poll-aggregation-approach" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-poll-aggregation-approach">The poll aggregation approach</h3>
<p>For the modelling approach I drew some inspiration from <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/hdsr_forecasting.pdf">Andrew Gelman</a> and others. Most of the current poll aggregation models apply some form of hierarchical linear modelling (HLM), combined with time trends, and often a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan-Abramowitz-4/publication/248650179_Forecasting_the_2008_Presidential_Election_with_the_Time-for-Change_Model/links/5613dc3808aec622440fd509/Forecasting-the-2008-Presidential-Election-with-the-Time-for-Change-Model.pdf">“fundamentals” component</a>. The general idea here is to partially pool information from many different pollsters, who are all utilizing slightly different samples of the population, with slightly different approaches.</p>
<p>For any individual poll we want to weight its contribution to the daily estimate based on known variables that affect responses (e.g: is this a partisan poll? is the poll registered or likely voters?), as well as “random” factors that sum to a distribution around a mean value (the distribution of responses by day, and by pollster). In addition, I wanted a model that also updated based on smooth time trends. While there are some nifty approaches using things like random-walk priors, I opted for a very simple cubic spine regression.</p>
</section>
<section id="fitting-the-models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fitting-the-models">Fitting the models</h3>
<p>To do this we fit the HLM component by applying fixed effects for partisan identification, the survey method (online, phone, or other), and the self-identified voting population (registered voters, likely voters, or adults). We apply varying intercepts for a day indicator, as well as for a pollster indicator. These varying intercepts apply partial pooling for each polling day as well as for pollster effects. In short, what this does is help pull polling estimates toward a group-level mean, and helps avoid any individual poll pulling the estimates too far in one direction - which is often referred to as “shrinkage”. I’ve actually written about this before in a blog post about <a href="https://gmcirco.github.io/blog/posts/hlm-osha/osha_shrinkage.html">estimating rare injury rates</a>. We also fit a very simple cubic spline regression with default <code>brms</code> parameters. The idea here is to get smoothed estimates over time to account for a baseline trend of public opinion.</p>
<p>We do all the model fitting using brms using a binomial regression model in the form <code>n_votes |trials(pop)</code> where <code>n_votes</code> is the predicted number of votes for a candidate given a survey sample size <code>pop</code>. Finally, we also weight the polls based on their <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/">numeric grade assigned by 538</a>. An example brms model looks something like the following below:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="post-hoc-weighting">Post-hoc weighting</h3>
<p>I likely deviated from accepted statistical dogma here by weighting the smoothing spline model and HLM using very ad-hoc approach. Early on I decided that I wanted my estimates to be mostly evenly controlled by the HLM and the smoothing spline, but I felt that the smoothing time trend would help eliminate a lot of the spikes on a day-to-day basic. I opted for a 60/40 weighting scheme that gave slightly more weight to the smoothing model. As you can see below, the combined “post-hoc” weighted predictions.</p>

<p>For clarity, we can add all the individual poll results showing the estimated support for Harris and Trump, with the size weighted by the number of respondents (larger polls get larger circles). Shown below, on the last day before the election we estimate a popular vote of 49.1% for Trump and 48.9% for Harris. Including the uncertainty basically makes estimating the winner essentially a coinflip.</p>

<p>Looking at my estimates, compared to the final count (as of 1/9/2025) the point estimates my model came up with are quite close to the observed results (Trump at 49.9% vs 49.1%, Harris at 48.9% vs 48.4%). Getting within a percentage point of the true value is pretty good, I think for a somewhat half-baked model! That being said, for the purposes of predicting who would ultimately win the day of, the margin of error on the predictions give us essentially no additional confidence beyond a 50/50 chance. This is pretty consistent with a lot of other pollsters who had fancier models. In the end, it was a very close election that was decided by a relatively small number of voters in key areas.</p>

  <title>Where Do Crime Guns in Your State Come From?</title>

<section id="tracing-the-flow-of-crime-guns" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tracing-the-flow-of-crime-guns">Tracing the Flow of Crime Guns</h2>
<p>For this post I rely on some data posted by <a href="https://www.ucmo.edu/harmon-college-of-business-and-professional-studies/department-of-economics-and-finance/faculty/david-johnson/">David Johnson</a>. He kindly made ATF gun trace data freely available <a href="https://osf.io/jwfdb/">here</a>, which I learned about via a <a href="https://x.com/DavidJo30329121/status/1827736995184931316">post on Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Going to have a new paper out soon that uses ATF gun trace data. Data is state level (2010-21) and has info on exported and imported crime guns … for example, exported crime guns are, from the context of FL, guns from FL but recovered in GA. Imported crime guns are guns from GA but recovered in FL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ATF data details the source of guns seized by the agency that were involved in crimes. This includes the state that the gun was originally registered in, the state that the gun was seized in, and the number of days from the date of registration to the gun’s involvement in a crime (a statistic referred to as “<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6814658/">time to crime</a>”). With this data we can examine flows of crime guns from their registered states to where they were eventually used in a crime.</p>
<p>To do this, I take the raw ATF files from the osf repository and process them in a little bit of code (see below). This code loops through the files from 2019 to 2021, strips off some unnecessary values, and then stacks them in a single data frame. We also do some basic computations to get the number and proportion of crime guns in a given state that were originally registered in <em>another</em> state.</p>

<p>For example, below we see that 16,371 guns were recovered in Alabama that were registered in Alabama, 1 gun that was registered in Alaska, and 59 that were registered in Arizona, and so on. We can also condense this table and find out the total proportion of crime guns that were registered in a state other than the state in which it was recovered:</p>

<p>Above we see that about 17% of crime guns seized in Alabama were registered outside the state, about 15% in Alaska, and for every other state. We can use this information to get a more comprehensive look at the sources and flows of guns.</p>
</section>
<section id="gun-control-and-crime-guns" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gun-control-and-crime-guns">Gun Control and Crime Guns</h2>
<p>The first thing we can do is visually assess which states have the greatest proportion of seized crime guns registered in other states. Visually, the map below has some fairly striking patterns. New England states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey all have very high proportions of crime guns imported from other states. In the Midwest we see Illinois is a bit of an outlier, wedged in between Wisconsin and Indiana. And out in the West we see California also has many crime guns imported from elsewhere.</p>

<figcaption>Many states in New England, as well as Illinois and California, have a high proportion of crime guns registered in other states.</figcaption>

<p>If we compare this map above to a map showing the number of restrictive gun laws passed (that is, any legislation that limits gun ownership, or repeals a previously permissive gun law) we see a fairly close overlap. California is noteworthy for having the largest raw number of restrictive gun legislation passed since 1990. States like Illinois, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Massachusetts also have much higher numbers of restrictive laws passed.</p>

<figcaption>States in the South, Southwest, and Northern New England pass fewer restrictive gun laws relative to other parts of the county.</figcaption>

<p>So does increased gun control cause the importation of guns outside that state? Well, a very basic comparison of the number of restrictive gun laws on the proportion of imported crime guns does seem to support that:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">

<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://gmcirco.github.io/blog/posts/crime-guns/crime-guns_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="672"></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the bottom-left corner there are a lot of states with relatively permissive gun laws who also import very few crime guns from other states. On the upper-right quadrant we see states with much more restrictive gun laws who have a much higher proportion of guns imported from other states. To be clear, this isn’t a huge revelation to many. There are a lot of studies showing how crime guns are imported through gun traffickers, out-of-state dealers, and straw purchasers <span class="citation" data-cites="cook2014some">(Cook et al. 2014)</span> which bypass the restrictive state laws.</p>
<p>With this data we can also look at some state-by-state patterns to observe where these flows of guns originate from. Logically, we would expect to see guns purchased in more permissive states to flow to less permissive ones. Below we have some examples from Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts.</p>
<section id="illinois" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="illinois">Illinois</h3>
<p>While I currently live in Connecticut, my home state of Illinois has had a long history with gun violence. Despite having more restrictive gun laws compared to much of the country, gun violence has been a serious and ongoing issue.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not much of a secret that many guns used in crimes come from nearby states with <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-crime-shooting-guns-illinois-gun-laws/11937013/">less restrictive laws</a>.Looking below we see that just under half of seized crime guns in Illinois are registered inside the state. Neighboring Indiana comprises about 17%, and then 5% and 4% from Missouri and Wisconsin, respectively.</p>

<p>In contrast to Illinois, many crime guns are imported from much farther away. The so called “iron pipeline” represents the interstate flow of guns from Southern states with relatively lax gun laws to the more restrictive states in New England <span class="citation" data-cites="braga2012interpreting">(Braga et al. 2012)</span>. In the map below it is quite clear that most of the out of state guns used in crimes come from Georgia, Virginia, and South Carolina.</p>

<p>Interestingly, while Massachusetts has similarly strict gun laws as New York, most of the crime guns actually flow from New Hampshire and Maine. While these states lie near the cluster of states with more restrictive laws, both New Hampshire and Maine are much more permissive with gun ownership. Here, their proximity is likely a larger factor in the proportion of imported guns relative to New York.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-this-mean-for-gun-control">What Does This Mean For Gun Control?</h2>
<p>I’ve done a lot of work on guns and gun violence in my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6ja2D_cAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">academic career</a>. To be clear, I believe gun ownership is a right that many owners take quite seriously (indeed, I am a gun owner as well). However, it’s also clear that the proliferation of guns in the United States is a serious public health problem <span class="citation" data-cites="bauchner2017death">(Bauchner et al. 2017)</span>. Laws restricting gun ownership in many cases makes sense - for example among perpetrators of intimate partner violence <span class="citation" data-cites="zeoli2016risks">(Zeoli, Malinski, and Turchan 2016)</span>. What is less clear is how we make this work in a country with a patchwork of laws and a highly politicized environment around gun ownership. While I think gun legislation is a key part of reducing the burden that gun violence plays in the US, I also think a more “holistic” approach is also needed to address other parts of the problem - like access to mental health and addressing concentrated disadvantage in many places. Given the environment we live in, simply passing more restrictive laws are unlikely to fix everything.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="code-tests">Code Tests</h2>
<p>Here’s a short one for a Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>At my day job we have a pretty simple coding test for first-round interviews for data scientists. I think we are actually pretty realistic and reasonable with what we ask experienced people to do in an interview. We don’t play around with leetcode or hackerrank stuff. We’re generally just looking for people who have a solid statistics and data science background, and who can demonstrate programming prowess. On our team many of us are expected to be “full-stack” (or nearly so), where we handle the development of models and deployment from the ground up.</p>
<p>We have a few questions, but one of the ones that seems to trip up a lot of people who claim experience with python is phrased something like this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Please create a python script to print ‘Hello World’ and execute it from the command line”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of this is due to how folks are instructed into data science. Lots of programs focus on highly containerized examples where everything is handled within a single notebook. Notebooks can be great for experimenting, but when it comes to model deployment you will need to learn how to set up environments, manage dependencies, etc…</p>
</section>
<section id="the-question" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-question">The Question</h2>
<p>So how do we go about answering this question? Well, I can break it down quite simply:</p>
<section id="step-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1">Step 1</h3>
<p>First I will assume you have python installed, and it is on your PATH (see a StackExchange post <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6318156/adding-python-to-path-on-windows">here</a> if you are not familiar). This is necessary so you can call python directly from the command line. When you’re installing python for the first time you typically can just click an option to add python to the PATH variables on Windows.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2">Step 2</h3>
<p>Now we just need to write the file and save it somewhere:</p>
<div id="948293bd" class="cell" data-execution_count="1">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">print</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"Hello World"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can literally just open a text file, add the code above, and then save the text file with a <code>.py</code> extension. I just saved it as <code>demo.py</code>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-what">So What?</h2>
<p>I know this is a bit of an “old man yells at cloud” kind of post, but I do have a deeper point here. Back when I was teaching stats as a professor many, <em>many</em> of my students did not know how file paths worked, how to navigate through directories, or even how to find a file that they downloaded off the class page! I don’t blame them at all - moreso I blame how most children and teens interact with computers - which is almost exclusively through apps and things like Chromebooks. They certainly make the user experience easy, but leave you with little understanding of how these tools actually work. For most people who don’t need to work in-depth with computers, it might be a huge issue. However, when we have data scientists who are flaunting 4-5 years of python experience and can’t execute a file using command prompt, it makes me a bit more concerned.</p>
<p>Personally, I think a lot of these “bootcamps” that promise to turn you into a fully-fledged data scientist in 12 weeks don’t really give you much more information than how to run off-the-shelf models in a notebook. Definitely good for a start, but woefully inadequate for real-world work. As a self-taught programmer I would highly encourage people interested in data-focused jobs to expand their horizons and broaden their skills.</p>
<p>Incidentally, my friend Andy Wheeler has a book which is a really great into to python on his personal website <a href="https://crimede-coder.com/store">here</a>. If you are at all interested in dipping your toes into python (especially if you are a crime analyst) I would highly reccomend it.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-with-bayesian-statistics">Working with Bayesian Statistics</h2>
<p>This is just a bit of fun, mostly for myself. In my day-to-day as a data scientist, I don’t get to use Bayesian statistics as much as I would like. In my role, a lot of the tools we use are things like boosted tree models, anomaly detection ensembles, and other less inferential models. That’s not to say I don’t think Bayesian methods can be used at my job, but there is definitely a different toolset involved.</p>
<p>I do a bit of side work (some for money, others just for fun) where I really do prefer to use Bayesian statistics. I’ve always liked the flexibility it allows in contrast to frequentist methods. In addition, I find it invaluable for stuff like psychometrics (e.g.&nbsp;IRT models) and survey analysis. I have to admit, I am a bit rusty with some of the foundations, and I’ve decided to make an abbreviated run through one of my favorite recent stats books: <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/">“Regression and Other Stories”</a>. The previous book that was absolutely invaluable for me in grad school was the 2007 <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/">“Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models”</a>. So for personal growth and fun, I’m going to work on a few interesting examples from this more recent book, starting from the beginning of the book all the way through the end - tossing in a bit of my own opinions on this.</p>

<p>Before working on anything too complicated, I think it is refreshing to start with a very simple regression problem. I know this already Chapter 8, but the first several chapters of the book are mostly a very basic intro into Bayesian statistics, data analysis, and some other more standard stuff. I’m choosing to skip ahead a bit. Chapter 8 starts with an introduction to a very simple bivariate regression using an interesting dataset from Douglas Hibbs’ fundementals-based election forecasting model (oddly appropriate, given when I am writing this):</p>

<p>The data below is part of Douglas Hibb’s <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30026466.pdf?casa_token=ndkpZ4OA8qsAAAAA:wmCzUl5_lrseqgvVh1QljGQcY4zt7RjL6qVVDpVx3FP7cH11_L_GYRP82RTjht1Q6jC8UpDiKVv97q1KAcvOzdj71tnb-YRpr_VKxlMiVoXrjuF0xzw">“Bread and Peace”</a> model of U.S. elections. The data below show the proportion of the 2-party vote share for the incumbent party against a measure of personal income growth during that party’s tenure. As seen in the plot, there appears to be a fairly strong relationship between the economic status under the incumbent party and their share of the 2 party vote.</p>

<p>Given this data we, therefore, have the simple regression equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20=%20%5Cbeta_0%20+%20%5Cbeta_%7B1%7Dincome%20+%20%5Cepsilon"></p>
<p>Where the expected two party vote share <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> is assumed to be a function of the change in personal income growth <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_1"> plus unmeasured residual error <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon">. So far this isn’t any different than your bog-standard <code>lm(y~x)</code> type model. The difference is how a Bayesian model handles the model parameters. In short, while a frequentist model views parameters as “fixed”, a Bayesian model views them as random variables modeled as draws from a posterior distribution. This posterior distribution is formed from a likelihood (the observed data), and a prior distribution.</p>
<p>Because this isn’t meant to be a full introduction to Bayesian inference, feel free to review some good articles <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/43586_2020_1_Author.pdfand">here</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01808">here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-bayesian-approach">The Bayesian approach</h3>
<p>For our models we have two sets of priors. One is a ‘flat’ prior which is drawn from a uniform distribution. This essentially adds zero additional information to the model. The other we can provide is an “informative” prior that contains some knowledge about the value of the estimates. This can be “weakly-informative” which just keeps the estimates within some reasonable bounds, or truly informative which reflects real-world knowledge. Here, I will add an informative prior to the second model reflecting my belief that a 1% increase in personal income growth is likely to increase vote share by about 3%, which is unlikely to be higher 5% or lower than 1%.</p>

<p>If we look at the parameter estimates from the two models we see they are roughly the same. A 1% increase in personal income growth is associated with a 3% increase increase in vote share for the incumbent party. Our choice of prior doesn’t really affect the point estimate, but we can see that restricting the plausible range has shrunk the standard error and credible interval range. This is because we are adding additional data to the model, based on our prior beliefs. Bayesian statistics in action!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="predictions-for-a-new-value-of-x">Predictions for a new value of <code>x</code></h3>
<p>Of course, we can also create a prediction for <code>y</code> given a new value of <code>x</code>. For example, what would the expected vote share be, given the growth in personal income was 2%? Here we can access the posterior distribution for a prediction of <code>y</code>. This prediction itself is constructed as a distribution from the posterior, which gives us a range of values for the prediction. Below we see the mean prediction for incumbent vote share where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x=2"> is 52.3, but this could plausibly range between as low as 44 or as high as 61.</p>

<p>We can also access simulations for the intercepts and slopes of each model. Below we have 100 draws from the posterior distribution, showing a range of values for the intercept and slope. Together, this gives us a range of plausible values for the predicted relationship between personal income growth and vote share.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it Up</h2>
<p>One lesson down. In this one I just ran through the most basic task of fitting an extremely simple regression. However, all the major parts of the Bayesian workflow are present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting priors</li>
<li>Estimating parameters from the model</li>
<li>Accessing posterior draws for prediction</li>
</ul>
<p>The third one is probably the most useful and important. Having access to the full posterior gives us incredible flexibility of what we want to do with the model (more on this soon!)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-one-big-thing-i-didnt-learn-in-grad-school">The One Big Thing I <em>Didn’t</em> Learn In Grad School</h2>
<p>When I was in grad school working on my Ph.D.&nbsp;I learned a lot about math, statistics, research methods, and experimental design (among a LOT of other things). For a good part of my time as a grad student I also worked doing crime analysis at the Detroit Police Department for <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24751979.2020.1827938">Ceasefire</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11292-019-09404-y">Project Green Light</a>. However, looking back, I realize one skill I never learned, that has become invaluable today, is something I never would have guessed: SQL. Yes, <em>that</em> SQL.</p>
<p>For my academic friends who aren’t in the know, SQL stands for “Structured Query Language” and is the number one way that analysts interface with data stored in databases. SQL is great because it is a fast and efficient way to pull data out of very large and complex tables. In addition it doesn’t require you to read an entire table into memory. For reference, at my day job I typically work with medical claims data tables with <em>billions</em> of records. It is simply not possible (nor recommended) to work with the entire table in-memory.</p>
<p>During grad school my typical workflow was to try and load a single large data table into R and work with it directly, or manually break it into smaller .csv files. Not only is this highly inefficient, it also makes it difficult to replicate the workflow later. I think being able to work with large complex datasets is increasingly important for researchers who want to take control of their workflow.</p>
</section>
<section id="duckdb-and-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="duckdb-and-r">DuckDB and R</h2>
<p>There are a lot of different ways to interface with SQL. In earlier projects I’ve used a SQLite database to manage a very large dataset and then query it from R. However, this approach requires you to create a <code>.sqlite</code> database and adds a bit of up-front work. Often times I might just have one or two very large tables where this approach is a bit overkill. For example, working with raw NIBRS data entails only a few important tables (victim, offender, offense) but each table is far too large to work with directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> is a great option here because it has a ton of very useful functions that allow you to read directly from a <code>.csv</code> or other type of file (JSON, Parquet,etc…). In addition this can work directly in <code>R</code> using a <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/api/r">client API</a>. For an academic, we often only have simple tables like these to work with and so having an option that we can easily integrate into our workflow is really appealing.</p>
<section id="setting-it-up" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-it-up">Setting it up</h3>
<p>As an example, I have some crime data from Detroit that I used for a project a few years back. The size of this file is large (although not <em>that</em> large). However it is big enough that it might be reasonable to pull only a subset of the data into memory at a time. Here’s a perfect use-case for duckDB. Below, I start by loading the <code>duckdb</code> library and setting up the working directory of the file location <code>dir</code> as a string. This will make it a bit cleaner to read and pass in to our queries when we start working.</p>

</div>
<p>We then set up a connection object via <code>dbConnect</code> and use <code>duckdb()</code> as the connector. After we do that all we need to do is built a SQL string and pass it in. The script below reads all the columns (<code>SELECT *</code>) from the table listed in the directory <code>crime.csv</code> and pulls only the top 10 rows. And this builds the connection and executes the query:</p>

<p>Voila! As an aside, if you are more familiar with <code>dplyr</code>’s syntax, the equivalent code would be. This is a bit less verbose, but requires you to read in the <em>entire</em> table before selecting just the top 10 rows. It is vastly less efficient and slow in cases where the table sizes become very large.</p>

<p>This is pretty cool too, because we have access to all the base functions available in duckDB. For example, there are a bunch of <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/date.html">date handling functions</a> that make these types of queries a lot easier than other base SQL languages. Here, the <code>datepart</code> function lets us split up date objects very easily within SQL.</p>

  <title>Creating Synthetic Spatial Data</title>

<section id="synthetic-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="synthetic-data">Synthetic Data</h2>
<p>In my work as a data scientist I have been working increasingly more with synthetic data generation. Synthetic data can be very useful when you are working on products that need reasonable stand-in values to test deployment. For example, a common issue I see is that a team needs data to populate a SQL table so they can populate a demo dashboard. Many times waiting for real data will take too long and unnecessarily stretch out the development time.</p>
<p>Now, when we talk about generating synthetic data we’re talking about more than just inserting random values into a table. Good synthetic data should mirror the properties of the original (or the properties of some pre-defined requirements). For example, you may want to have an age and race field that match the same demographics of the U.S. Census. Or you might need the relationship between two fields to be consistent - like a medical procedure field matched with a cost field.</p>
<p>An interesting question I posed to myself was “What if I wanted to generate synthetic <em>spatial</em> data?” This is an interesting question, because spatial data need to have additional properties matched. Of course if we want to simulate crimes in a city, we can’t just randomly throw points on the map. Crime does <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-9125.12070">not occur randomly</a>, and so if we want to simulate realistic processes, we need methods that generate them accurately.</p>
<section id="simulating-crime-at-gas-stations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simulating-crime-at-gas-stations">Simulating Crime at Gas Stations</h3>
<p>My idea here is to try and simulate many different realizations of gas station locations in the region. We don’t necessarily care if they exactly match a <em>real</em> location, but we care more about the intensity of the pattern. The data I’m using is some Hartford crime data that I collected for my <a href="https://github.com/gmcirco/quickGrid">quickGrid</a> package.</p>
<p>Below is the locations of gas stations (blue) and robbery incidents (red).</p>

<p>What we want to do is take this information and simulate, many times, different synthetic realizations of this pattern (gas stations and robberies). In practice we could use these simulated datasets to test a statistical method, populate some dashboard or map using de-identified data, or as a step in generating some new model.</p>

<section id="simulating-gas-station-locations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simulating-gas-station-locations">Simulating Gas Station Locations</h2>
<p>For this example we’ll start with gas stations. Ideally we want to simulate an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process#Inhomogeneous_Poisson_point_process">Inhomogeneous Poisson point process</a>. In simple terms, this means that the intensity of the point pattern <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?lambda"> is not constant across the study region. Logically this makes sense because gas stations are typically confined to commercial areas and don’t appear randomly in the middle of parks or waterways.</p>
<p>In R this is easy to do. We can calculate the intensity of gas station locations by computing the kernel density of observed locations, and then use those density values as input for our simulation. We can do the same for robberies as well.</p>

<p>As we simulate the position of gas stations in the city, we will want to make sure they are relatively consistent with the patterns observed in reality. For example: we wouldn’t expect all 50ish gas stations to be right on top of each other - nor would we expect to see them scattered randomly. What we can do is compute the clustering intensity of the observed point pattern, and then compare that to our simulations.</p>

<p>This plots the minimum and maximum envelopes (in grey) of the simulations against the observed K values in red. In general, we see that the pairwise relationships between gas stations is fairly close to observed, expect at small spatial scales. We appear to be failing to simulate cases where many gas stations are near each other (such as at 4 way intersections with a station on each corner).</p>

<p>Naturally, it makes sense to use simulations of both robberies <em>and</em> gas stations to create our simulated crime and location data. We should check the cross-K function between our simulated gas stations and simulated robberies. In these cases it is often easier to assess this by performing a transformation of the K function to the variance-stabilized L function. If we subtract the distance at each value of L we get the L-cross - r which is a handy way to visualize a point process.</p>

<p>And this is why it is important to check. We can clearly see that while our simulated data is fairly close to the observed pattern for most distances 1000 feet and beyond, there is much <em>less</em> clustering at small spatial scales. This makes sense, because of how crime is often geo-coded. When you have crimes that occur directly on the location they will typically share the same coordinates. In our case, our points are more spread out than we would expect to see in real life.</p>
<p>Whether or not this data is “good enough” will depend on the use case at hand. In many cases very rough synthetic data can suffice for many purposes. In other cases, where high-fidelity synthetic data is needed, considerably more post-processing is required to bring the synthetic data in line with the real.</p>

  <title>If You Order Chipotle Online, You Are Probably Getting Less Food</title>

<section id="how-inconsistent-are-chipotle-orders" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-inconsistent-are-chipotle-orders">How Inconsistent are Chipotle Orders?</h2>
<p>Here’s a quick one. The question posed here is “do you get less food if you order your Chipotle order online versus in person?” There are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chipotle/comments/cgw24i/less_food_in_bowl_when_you_order_online/">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/chipotle-order-online-less-food-theory/">of</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@seangransee/heres-how-much-sweetgreen-shorts-you-when-you-order-online-with-data-c93fb5bc6e26">posts</a> going back years claiming that their orders are smaller if they order online.</p>
<p>I happened to be watching a video from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZackarySmigel">Zackary Smigel</a> who decided to <a href="https://youtu.be/kZe5k95U-UY?si=Z5VjqGn6hZx9ZIHf">eat nothing but Chipotle for 30 days</a>. One of the interesting things in his video is that he provided his data for 30 consecutive Chipotle visits <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PluJeBD1aJ36xAKbZ74OHED00ntwhjH81q2wINg5UDw/edit#gid=0">here</a>. what Zackary might not have known is that he unintentionally created a very nice blocked experiment design. What this means is we can easily identify sources of variation in order weight by controlling for other variables present.</p>
<p>I downloaded the data from the Google Sheet, saved a few of the columns locally as a .csv and did some minimal processing.</p>

<p>So for every order he made, we can control for whether it was in-person or online, the type of meat used in the order, the store it originated from, and the type of food (either a burrito or a bowl).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-get-less-food-online">Do you get less food online?</h2>
<p>Let’s answer this question. To start, we can look at the general distribution of weights. Below we see that the median weight of an order is just under 800 grams, or about 1.7 pounds. The largest order he got was a whopping 2.3 pounds, and the smallest was 1.1 pounds.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>If we plot out a little density plot we can see the distribution of weights is (approximately) normal, with online orders appearing to be a bit lighter than in-person ones. Without adjusting for anything else, the median weight of online orders is about 709 grams, and in-person orders are 907. However, just based on this visual we can’t be certain it isn’t due to other factors (for example, maybe he ordered more heavy items only online).</p>

<p>To determine whether online orders weigh less than in-person orders, we can just apply some simple statistics. Here, I fit a linear regression with each blocking factor. In this way we “control” for variables we know affect order weight (e.g.&nbsp;bowls weigh more than burritos, or store 3 gives you more food than store 1). In the end all we care about is the coefficient for the effect of ordering online relative to ordering in-person.</p>

<p>So what does this mean? Well, after controlling for the other variables we see that the effect of ordering in-person relative to online is <strong>160 grams more food</strong> (or about 5.6 ounces). Based on the orders he submitted that roughly equates to 20% more food from ordering in-person rather than online!</p>
<p>So, yes, in this case it does appear that ordering online resulted in smaller orders relative to in-person.</p>

<section id="caveats" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
<p>All of this analysis assumes that the online orders were roughly equivalent to the in-person one (e.g.&nbsp;ordering the same ingredients online as in-person). This would <em>not</em> be valid if he tended to order more additional items when in the store rather then online. However, from watching the video and looking at the listed cost of all items ($11.00) it appears that the orders are comparable.</p>
<p>I would also caution against extrapolation. The data here comes for 30 orders from a single city in the US. It is a limited set of data with a limited number of observations. So, as always with science, some degree of skepticism is always warranted.</p>

<section id="the-paper" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-paper">The Paper</h2>
<p>I recently found a paper published called “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=HWD8EAAAQBAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PA184&amp;hl=en&amp;source=newbks_fb">Advancing Recidivism Prediction for Male Juvenile Offenders: A Machine Learning Approach Applied to Prisoners in Hunan Province</a>”. In it, the authors make use of a very small recidivism data set focusing on youth in Hunan province, which originally appears in a 2017 PLOS ONE article here: “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169251">Predicting Reoffending Using the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY): A 5-Year Follow-Up Study of Male Juvenile Offenders in Hunan Province, China</a>”.</p>
<p>The authors of the new study explain how they can use machine learning to improve the prediction of recidivism (which, in of itself is a highly contentious topic). In general, it is a pretty harmless paper of virtually zero significance. They’re using an absurdly tiny data set to test out machine learning models that only really work well when you are flush with data. However, a single line stuck out to me when I was scanning their paper:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The proposed ML models perform best on the oversampled dataset, as illustrated in Fig. 2.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh oh.</p>
<p>Looking at the associated figure and table they show off some impressive metrics. Their random forest model has a precision and recall of 97%! On a recidivism prediction task this alone is highly suspicious. For example, in the competition I participated (and won in several categories), our model only averaged about .78 to .8. Why is theirs so good here? Well, it’s all about that line above. Let’s run through the data and explain:</p>

<p>The normal workflow in this case is to set up a test-train split, fit a model on the training data set, then evaluate the out-of-sample performance on the test set. Despite the very small sample size here I’ll just follow the bog standard approach to illustrate. A 20% test set gives us: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?246%20-%20(246*.2)%20=%20196.8">. So just under 200 cases to train on, which is really <em>quite</em> small.</p>

<p>So about .74 for the logistic regression and .72 for the random forest. Not great, not terrible.</p>
</section>
<section id="doing-it-with-smote" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="doing-it-with-smote">Doing it with SMOTE</h2>
<p>So the argument with SMOTE is that training models on data sets with very large imbalances in positive vs.&nbsp;negative cases is that the models only learn from the negative cases and not the positive ones. A good example might be a fraud data set where you have 100,000 legitimate credit card transactions and only 500 cases of fraud (so something like .5%). SMOTE is intended to help with training a model by synthesizing a balanced data set where the ratio of positive to negative cases are much closer to 50/50. Without going too much into it, this actually rarely solves and problems and often induces some.</p>
<p>What I suspect the authors of this paper did is that they generated a SMOTE data set with a balanced ratio of positive to negative cases, then created a test-train split from <em>that</em> data set, and evaluated their metrics on a test data set derived from the SMOTE model. That is very, <em>very</em> wrong.</p>
<section id="doing-smote-the-wrong-way" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="doing-smote-the-wrong-way">Doing SMOTE the wrong way</h3>
<p>So let’s try it. I’ll synthesize a SMOTE data set from the full set of cases, then walk through the whole process using <em>only</em> the synthesized data. This creates a data set with 126 new observations, and brings the balance of positive to negative cases to almost exactly 50/50 (rather than 25/75 in the original).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In summary, if you wrongfully evaluate your model that was trained on a SMOTE data set against a hold-out sample from that same SMOTE data your out-of-sample metrics will be falsely confident. It is much easier to perform classification on data that are artificially balanced. However, actually using these models in real life entails data that almost never follow this.</p>
<p>Finally, I don’t mean to focus on these authors specifically. The analysis they are doing is with some good intentions, but is mostly misguided. The data here are mostly unsuited for examining more complex models and processes. In addition, what I see here is a common issue for many data analysts, which is why being thoughtful and careful at the start of your analysis is very important.</p>

  <title>An Outsider’s Perspective On Media Mix Modelling</title>

<section id="media-mix-modelling" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="media-mix-modelling">Media Mix Modelling</h2>
<p>I’m trying something a bit new this time. Typically how I learn is that I see something interesting (either in a blog post, an academic article, or through something a co-worker is working on). I’ll then try and work through the problem via code on my own to see how I can make it work. It’s not always perfect, but it gets me started. Today I’m going to go out of my comfort zone and try my hand at <strong>Media Mix Modelling</strong> (MMM).</p>
<p>In general, the stated goal of MMM is to determine the optimal distribution of advertising money, given <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> different venues. For instance, this could determine how much to spend on internet, TV, or radio advertising given the costs of running ads and the expected return for each venue. Typically this is done using a regression to try and parse out the effect of each type of advertising net of many other factors (e.g.&nbsp;seasonal and trend effects, costs of the product, demand, etc…).</p>
<section id="getting-some-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-some-data">Getting some data</h3>
<p>Getting reliable open-source data for MMM is actually a bit more difficult than you think. There are a number of very trivial simulated datasets scattered about on places like Kaggle, but these aren’t terribly useful. I was able to find a strange mostly undocumented set of data from a git repo <a href="https://github.com/jamesrawlins1000/Market-mix-modelling-data">here</a>. Per the author, the data purports:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…data contain information on demand, sales, supply, POS data, advertisiment expenditure and different impressions recorded across multiple channels for calculating the advertising campaign effectiveness such as Mobile SMS, Newspaper Ads, Radio, TV, Poster, Internet etc.in the form of GRP (Gross Rating Point) in Shenzhen city”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good enough for me.</p>

<section id="the-adstock-function" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-adstock-function">The Adstock Function</h2>
<p>The paper <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46001.pdf">Bayesian Methods for Media Mix Modeling with Carryover and Shape Effects</a> is a pretty clear and concise introduction to media mix modelling. This paper is a pretty good introduction into many of the issues related to MMM. One of the biggest issues is the need to transform the ad spend variables to better represent how they behave in real life. For example, we don’t necessarily expect an ad campaign to have an <em>instantaneous</em> lift, nor do we expect its effect to end immediately either. Hence, the need to model appropriate <a href="">carryover effects</a>.</p>
<p>To do this I’ll borrow a function <a href="https://medium.com/@kyliefu/implementation-of-the-advertising-adstock-theory-in-r-62c2cc4b82fd">Kylie Fu</a> to calculate the weights for the delayed adstock function. The goal here is to define a function that can transform the ad spend variables to reflect our belief that they have delays of decay, delays of peak effect, and an upper maximum carryover effect. Below the function takes a vector of ad spend data and creates the transformation given the parameters <code>lambda</code>, <code>theta</code>, and <code>L</code>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-up-an-adstock-transformation">Setting up an adstock transformation</h3>
<p>Now we can choose the parameters for the adstock transformation. Ideally, we want a transformation that captures the decay of the advertising program (<code>lambda</code>), its delayed peak onset (<code>theta</code>), and its maximum effect duration (<code>L</code>). With a bit of simulation we can see what each parameter does across a value of different lags. The goal here is to have a function that matches what we believe the actual effect of ad spending looks like for different media regions (e.g.&nbsp;TV, radio, internet). Below, we can see that increasing <code>lambda</code> increases the decay of the effect up, while varying <code>theta</code> sets the peak onset of the ad campaign to later lags. The value of <code>L</code> simply sets the maximum effect to a specific lag.</p>

<p>Based on a visual assesment I just chose an adstock function with a lambda of .8 (suggesting moderate decay of the initial ad effect), a theta of 2 (implying a peak onset of 2 weeks), and an L of 13 which is a rule-of-thumb that makes the maximum effect quite large.</p>

<p>The code below applies our adstock function to each of the spend variables. For simplicity here I am making the assumption that all of the modes have similar adstock functions, but this can (and should) vary per modality based on expert prior information. We convert the daily data (which is quite noisy) to a more commonly utilized weekly format. We then limit the focus of our analysis to a 4-year time span.</p>

<p>Before we fit the model we can plot out the primary variables of interest, along with our dependent variable <code>sales</code>. Looking below we can see a few potential issues. One which should jump out immediately is that there is a <em>very</em> high correlation between several of our ad spend categories. For example, the correlation between TV spending and news spending is almost 1. In the case of MMM this is a common problem, which makes unique identification of the effect of ad spends much more difficult. More troubling, by just eyeballing these plots there doesn’t seem to be a terribly strong relationship between <em>any</em> of the advertising venues and sales.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges with MMM is that many of the model coefficients including the advertising venues, are likely to be <em>very</em> highly correlated. For example, the advertising spend on TV ads is almost perfectly correlated with the spend on news ads. We can set some moderately strong priors on the ad spend coefficients to ensure that the estimates don’t explode due to multicollinearity. Here I’m just placing a <code>normal(0, .5)</code> prior which is still pretty wide for a coefficient on the logrithmic scale.</p>

<p>Now we can evaluate the models. Here, I evaluate a model with random effects for month and week, and a smoothing spline for the trend component against a fixed effects model with a linear trend, and a “null” model with just an intercept. The model with a smooth trend spline appears to beat out the linear trend, which makes sense given the non-linear bump in sales observed in the raw data.</p>

<p>We can (and should) also check out the predictions from the model using a posterior predictive check. In Bayesian terms what this means is we take a sample of draws from our fitted model and compare them against the observed data. If our model is capturing the process well, the predicted values should generally follow the observed process. Below we see that our model does a fairly decent job.</p>

<p>At this point there is a <em>lot</em> of additional work that can be done. Most applied uses of MMM apply some optimization algorithms to determine the best ad spend mix given a fixed budget. The data I have here isn’t really good enough to delve any deeper into - but its important to note that fitting the model is really only the beginning.</p>

<p>My biggest problem with Mixed Media Modelling is that it seems like it is easy to implement badly, but much harder to do well. Not only do you have to appropriately model an adstock function for your advertising venues, you also have very high correlation between your variables. This, in turn, makes the choice of model specification even more important because the coefficients with be <em>highly</em> sensitive. Personally, a true experiment or even quasi-experiment would be preferable to this - although I’m all too aware that this is often impossible. Like everything there is no magic bullet, and choosing one approach over another will always introduce trade offs.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick one. I was recently asked how you might plot the travel of individuals over time on a map. For example, if you had longitudinal data recording the residences of respondents over a course of many years, it might be interesting to see to where and how far they traveled. Doing this in R isn’t too difficult, but it isn’t quite straightforward either. Below I’ll show off my approach using the <code>sf</code> package.</p>

<p>Let’s say we have some data which lists the name of a person, the cities they’ve been to, and the dates they moved. We want to create a plot that draws a line (in order) of their travel between cities. A sample dataset might look something like this below. We have a person identifier and a sequence of dates that display the dates they lived in a location, along with the associated latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>Now what we want to do is find a way to plot these as a linestring on a map. To do this we can create a simple function that will take this dataframe as input, and assume that for each sequence of points they are ordered from oldest to newest. The function will then extract the points and create an <code>st_linestring</code> object that links them together. Because <code>sf</code> objects interface well with <code>ggplot</code> you can easily make a direct call to plot ontop of a base map.</p>

We can easily extend the function defined above and wrap it in a for-loop. To illustrate what this looks like I simulate some data for 100 theoretical trips between 2 and 5 cities:</p>

<p>So we just simulate a lot of journeys that go between 2 and 5 states, store them in a list, then run our <code>linestring_list</code> function over it. The for-loop to add lines is a bit hack-y, but it works. We can then just plot them out:</p>

<p>And if we want to know how far, on average, each person traveled, we can just compute the sum of distances across our list. Simple!</p>

  <title>Using NLP To Classify Medical Falls</title>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="natural-language-processing-and-deep-learning">Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning</h2>
<p>There’s no question that natural language processing (NLP) facilitated by deep learning has exploded in popularity (much of which is popularized by the ChatGPT family of models). This is an exciting time to be involved in AI and machine learning. However, for the kinds of tasks I typically work on in my day job, a lot of the deep learning models don’t provide much benefit. In fact, for most tabular data problems, random forests + boosting tend to work incredibly well. Areas where deep learning excels, like unstructured text or image input, are not things I find myself working on. That being said, I am always sharpening my skills and dipping my toes into areas where I am least familiar.</p>
<p>A huge advantage today, compared to even ten years ago, is the ecosystem of open data and pre-trained models. <a href="https://huggingface.co/">HuggingFace</a> in particular has a lot of easily obtainable pre-trained models. Stuff like the <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index">Transformers</a> library make it easy for a neophyte like me to hop in and start doing work without too much overhead.</p>

<section id="predicting-elderly-falls-from-medical-narratives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="predicting-elderly-falls-from-medical-narratives">Predicting Elderly Falls from Medical Narratives</h2>
<p>For this example I am going to rely on some data from <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/217/cdc-fall-narratives/page/763/">DrivenData</a> - an organization that hosts data competitions. The data here are verified fall events for adults aged 65+. This sample comes more broadly from the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data">National Electronic Injury Survellience System</a>(NEISS). This is useful because the sample of cases here are human-verified falls cases, in which case we have a source of truth. While you could probably get pretty far just doing some regex like <code>str.match("FALL|FELL|SLIPPED")</code> but it would likely miss more subtle cases. This is where having something like a BERT model is useful.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have a set of verified falls narratives (which we do) and we have a large set of miscellanous narratives that contain falls cases, as well as other injuries that are not falls. Our goal is to find narratives that are likely to be related to elderly fall cases. To do this, we will use the verified falls cases narratives from DataDriven as our “training data” so to speak, and we will use an NLP model to find cases that are semantically similar to these verified falls cases.</p>

<p>To get set up we read in the verified falls narratives, as well as the full sample of NEIS cases from 2022. After reading in our data we can perform some minor data cleaning to the narratives. Specifically, because we want to isolate narrative characterics associated with falls we should exclude the leading information about the patient’s age and sex, as well as some other medical terminology. We can also remap some abbreviations to English and properly extract the actual age of the patient from the narrative.</p>

<p>We can see that our coding changes the narratives subtly. For example this string:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="4">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1">falls[<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;

<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="4">
<pre><code>'87YOF HAD A FALL TO THE FLOOR AT THE NH STRUCK BACK OF HEAD HEMATOMA TO SCALP'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Is changed to this:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="5">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1">falls[<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;

<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="5">
<pre><code>'HAD A FALL TO THE FLOOR AT THE NURSING HOME STRUCK BACK OF HEAD HEMATOMA TO SCALP'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This minimal amount of pre-processing should help the model identify similar cases without being affected by too much extranenous information. In addition, because the typical model has about 30,000 words encoded we need to make sure we avoid abbreviations which will be absent from the model dictionary.</p>

<p>We can grab all of our verified fall narratives as well as a random sample of narratives from the 2022 NEIS data. Below we’ll take a sample of 250 cases and run them through our model.</p>

</div>
<p>We take the processed narratives and convert them to tokens using the pre-trained sentence transformer:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="7">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb9-1">embed_train <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> model.encode(neis_narrative)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>We then compute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">cosine similarity</a> between the two tensors. What we will end up with is the distance from our NEIS narratives and the verified fall cases. Cases with larger distances should be less likely to contain information about elderly fall cases.</p>

</div>
<p>For simplicity we scale the distances between 0 and 1, so that 1 is most similar and 0 is least similar. We can then just compare the rank-ordered narratives.</p>

<p>Plotting a histogram of the minmax scaled cosine similarity scores shows a lot of narratives that are very similar and a long tail of those that are not so similar. Of course, there isn’t a single cut point of what we would consider acceptable for classification purposes, but we could certainly use these scores in a regression to determine a suitible cut point if we were so interested.</p>

<p>So in general, it did a pretty good job. The most similar cases are all clearly related to falls, while the least similar ones are all a mix of other injuries. While I don’t have any tests here (coming soon!) I suspect this does better than very simple regex queries. If only because it has the ability to find similarities without needing to match on specific strings.</p>

 'FELL IN THE SHOWER  FRACTURED UPPER BACK',
 'PATIENT FELL IN THE SHOWER AND HIT HER HEAD AND HER LEFT ELBOW  LACERATION OF SCALP WITHOUT FOREIGN BODY STRUCK BATH TUB WITH FALL ABRASION OF LEFT ELBOW',

</div>
</div>
<p>Now <em>this</em> is cool. Using the sentence transformer we are able to get passages that are similar in style to what we searched, without sharing the exact same language. For example, the search query is <code>"SLIPPED IN BATHTUB"</code> but we get results like <code>"FELL IN THE SHOWER"</code> and <code>"SLIP AND FALL IN THE TUB"</code>. If we were looking specifically for passages related to falls in the bathtub these obviously make sense (many bathtubs are also just showers as well).</p>

<p>Now, this isn’t probably news to most people that actually regularly work with language models. However, it is quite impressive that with a pre-trained model and very minimal pre-processing, you can obtain reasonable results off-the-shelf. I’ll definitely be keeping my eyes on these models in the future and looking for ways where they can improve my workflow.</p>

  <title>The Great American Coffee Taste Test</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="the-great-american-coffee-taste-test" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-great-american-coffee-taste-test">The Great American Coffee Taste Test</h2>
<p>In October I was lucky enough to participate in popular coffee YouTuber James Hoffman’s <a href="https://cometeer.com/pages/the-great-american-coffee-taste-test">Great American Coffee Taste Test</a>. In short, participants got 4 samples of coffee and were able to brew, taste, and rate them live. One the interesting parts of this was that the data was freely shared after the tasting was completed. As both a data and coffee nerd, I couldn’t resit a dive into this dataset.</p>
<p>The one we’re going to focus on is the unusual <a href="https://youtu.be/bMOOQfeloH0?si=E9xaNcI-JBsR8-Yw&amp;t=422"><strong>Coffee ‘D’</strong></a>. In contrast to the other coffees in the taste test, Coffee ‘D’ was a natural process. The difference between a washed coffee and natural coffee is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Washed coffee and natural process coffee differ primarily in their processing methods. Washed coffee involves removing the outer fruit from the coffee bean before drying, using water to ferment and wash away the pulp, resulting in a clean, bright flavor profile with pronounced acidity. In contrast, natural process coffee involves drying the whole coffee cherry intact, allowing the bean to ferment inside the fruit, imparting a fruitier, sometimes wine-like, sweetness with a heavier body due to prolonged contact with the fruit, often exhibiting complex, earthy, or fermented flavor notes. These distinct processes significantly influence the taste and characteristics of the final brew, offering a spectrum of flavors to coffee enthusiasts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tl;dr is that natural process coffees tend to have more fermented, fruity flavors that are prized by some consumers, but often disliked by others. This is the one we’re going to focus our attention on here.</p>
<section id="the-survey" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-survey">The survey</h3>
<p>While there were numerous questions on the <a href="https://tally.so/r/wzy48M">survey</a>, my focus was primarily on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Self-rated coffee expertise</li>
</ul>
<p>I categorized ages into groups (<code>18-24</code>, <code>25-34</code>, <code>35-44</code>, <code>45-54</code>, and <code>55+</code>), and gender into <code>(Male</code>, <code>Female</code>). The self-rated coffee expertise was on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 representing <em>“I’m a novice”</em> and 10 representing <em>“I’m a coffee expert.”</em></p>
<p>Initially, we need to convert the survey data from a wide format to a long one. In the current data view, each person’s response is repeated four times (once for each coffee type), while their age, gender, and self-reported coffee expertise remain constant. This approach allows us to model responses more efficiently and retain information across different coffee types.</p>

<p>We’re employing an ordinal regression model with a cumulative link function, which is a typical method for analyzing Likert-style data. Gender remains constant across all coffee categories, while we permit the effects of age and expertise to differ for each type of coffee. Essentially, this suggests that we assume broader gender differences for all coffees, while acknowledging that the effects of age and expertise may differ across various coffee types.</p>

<p>There are a few divergent transitions after fitting, but that can be fixed by upping the <code>adapt_delta</code> parameter. In general I’m satisfied with the fit, as all of our <code>Rhat</code> values are equal to 1.00, and the <code>Bulk_ESS</code> and <code>Tail_ESS</code> look fine too.</p>
<p>After fitting the model, we can get some initial insights by plotting out some of the model coefficients. Specifically, we probably want to focus our attention on the varying effects for age and expertise on coffee preferences. We can do this by extracting the random effects from the model and plotting them. Here, we can see the estimated effect of age on preferences for each coffee (relative to the 18-24 group).</p>

<p>Let’s start by looking at <em>all</em> the predicted rankings for coffee ‘D’. In this case we have 500 different predictions, corresponding to all possible age x gender x expertise x ranking combinations. Each individual line represents the estimated ranking for a particular consumer.</p>

<p>Using this data we can do some simple comparisons. For example: what is the estimated difference between males and females ranking coffee ‘D’? In his summary, James Hoffman highlighted that <a href="https://youtu.be/bMOOQfeloH0?si=Nljr4mcZoLswoW0p&amp;t=479">females were much more likely</a> to strongly dislike coffee ‘D’ relative to males. However, if you look at the data, females in the survey also generally reported much less expertise in coffee.</p>
<p>So what if we control for expertise, and see what the estimated difference in gender is assuming they are otherwise comparable coffee consumers. Below, we set the expertise for predictions to the median, which is 6.</p>

Figure&nbsp;1: Coffee rankings for males and females, across all age groups
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And here are the estimates for males and females, holding age constant at 25-34 and self-reported expertise to the median (6). As we can see both males and females with similar expertise within the same age groups largely rate coffee D similarly, with the largest difference being for ranking it a 5.</p>

</div>
<p>So really, there aren’t very large difference in regards to gender after we control for expertise. The large gender difference that James sees in the survey is likely mostly an artifact of differences in experience with coffee between males and females<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>In fact, if we look at the differences in self-reported expertise we have estimated rankings for a male, aged 25-34 for self-reported expertise at 1, 5, and 10. As is fairly clear, the distribution of estimated rankings is <em>substantially</em> different across levels of expertise. For example, we estimate about an 80% probability that a person with a self-assessed expertise of 10 to rate coffee ‘D’ a 4 or 5. In contrast that drops to about 45% for a person with an expertise of 5, and 20% for a person with an expertise of 1.</p>

<p>If it’s not already clear, the biggest differences in rating the unusual natural-process coffee is not really related to gender, but rather it is mostly based on an individuals expertise or ‘expertise’ with coffee.</p>

<p>So now that we have our model, we can use it to pose any number of comparisons by relying on posterior draws.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at the most common age-gender-expertise combinations. Below we see that males largely make up the most common individuals who completed the survey. From a hypothetical perspective, let’s compare how the most common male respondent (between 25-34 years old with an expertise of 7) would rate a given coffee compared to the most common female respondent (25-34 with an expertise of 5).</p>

<p>Then we can put them into a dataframe and plot their distributions. As we can see, they are quite far apart. A 25-34 year old male with an expertise of 7 has a probability of about 35% of scoring coffee ‘D’ a 5, compared to 19% for female with an expertise of 5.</p>

  <title>Synthetic Controls and Small Areas</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="synthetic-controls-in-statistics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="synthetic-controls-in-statistics">Synthetic Controls in Statistics</h2>
<p><a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/10/12/debate-over-effect-of-reduced-prosecutions-on-urban-homicides-also-larger-questions-about-synthetic-control-methods-in-causal-inference/">Andrew Gelman</a> recently covered a mildly <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9133.12597">controversial paper</a> in criminology that suggested that a policy of “de-prosecution” by the Philadelphia District Attorney’s office resulted in an increase in homicides. This has sparked a lot of back-and-forth discussion on the appropriateness of the analysis and the kind of synthetic control method used. I’m not here to discuss any of these things, as many other smart people have already debated this to death (plus, given Hogan is reticent to release his data or code we may never really know exactly <em>what</em> he did).</p>
<p>However, what I do want to discuss is something else Gelman wrote about on his blog:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hogan and the others make comparisons, but the comparisons they make are to that weighted average of Detroit, New Orleans, and New York. The trouble is . . . that’s just 3 cities, and homicide rates can vary a lot from city to city. It just doesn’t make sense to throw away the other 96 cities in your data. The implied counterfactual is that if Philadelphia had continued post-2014 with its earlier sentencing policy, that its homicide rates would look like this weighted average of Detroit, New Orleans, and New York…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Gelman is talking about here is the commonly-used <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/t0335/t0335.pdf"><strong>ADH approach</strong></a> (short for Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller). In this method you typically have one large “treated” area - such as a city or state - that implements some kind of policy. You then use other comparably large or similar areas to construct a synthetic version of your treated unit to estimate the counterfactual. It’s an appealing method because it is relatively simple to calculate, fairly transparent about where the weights come from, and has good overlap with more conventional difference-in-differences methods (non-negative weights with a sum-to-one constraint). So in a way, I don’t necessarily have the same issues that Gelman does, but he brings up a good point. By using only large aggregate units there is an inherent loss of information. In the ADH method we sort of assume that by matching closely on the outcome variable we can average over a lot of the confounders. Although in the ADH method you can also match on other covariates - but in my experience the vast majority of the synthetic control weights are derived solely from the pre-treatment outcomes.</p>
<section id="micro-synthetic-controls" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="micro-synthetic-controls">Micro-Synthetic Controls</h3>
<p>Gelman further writes:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>My understanding of a synthetic controls analysis went like this. You want to compare Philadelphia to other cities, but there are no other cities that are just like Philadelphia, so you break up the city into neighborhoods and find comparable neighborhoods in other cities . . . and when you’re done you’ve created this composite “city,” using pieces of other cities, that functions as a pseudo-Philadelphia. In creating this composite, you use lots of neighborhood characteristics, not just matching on a single outcome variable. And then you do all of this with other cities in your treatment group (cities that followed a de-prosecution strategy).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which describes another approach that has grown in popularity, especially among criminologists. This so-called “micro-synthetic” approach constructs synthetic controls from many small pieces to comprise a larger treated piece. The classic criminological example might be that you have a neighborhood in your city with 20 census blocks that gets some focused deterrence intervention. You can use the remaining “untreated” census blocks in the city to use as composite pieces as part of the synthetic control. This approach is especially appealing because so much criminological research has a focus on small, disaggregated regions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-example-operation-impact-2014">An Example: Operation Impact (2014)</h2>
<p>As a quick demo, here’s an example I presented for part of NIJ’s <a href="https://bja.ojp.gov/program/crppe/smart-suite">Smart Suite</a>. The research question posed here is whether a surge in police activity New York City’s 47th precinct reduced assaults or robberies. There were a number of previous iterations of Operation Impact which an evaluation found a general decrease in crime<span class="citation" data-cites="macdonald2016effects">(MacDonald, Fagan, and Geller 2016)</span>. The example here looks at a much later surge in 2014:</p>
<p><img src="https://gmcirco.github.io/blog/posts/synth-impact/impact_79.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The data I organized for this example contains block-level census data from the American Community Survey, as well as monthly counts of some major crime categories (here: assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, robbery, and larceny-theft). This is organized in a long-form dataset, which is indexed by precinct * geoid * month.</p>

<p>The precinct we’re interested in, the 47th, is comprised of 44 census blocks which are each measured at 12 time points. The remainder of the census blocks in the dataset are part of our “donor” pool, which we can use for our synthetic control.</p>

<p>The R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/microsynth/vignettes/introduction.html">microsynth</a> does almost all of the heavy lifting<span class="citation" data-cites="robbins2021microsynth">(Robbins and Davenport 2021)</span>. Without getting too much into the weeds, the general idea here is that we want to re-weight all of our untreated (non-Operation Impact) census blocks in a way that makes them nearly - or exactly - identical to the census blocks in the 47th precinct. Microsynth accomplishes this much in the same way that surveys are weighted to approximate the population of interest. However, instead here we treat the 47th precinct as our “population” and estimate weights to apprxomiate the pre-treatment outcomes and covariates in the treated precinct. The full code to run the model is below:</p>

<p>As a start, we can assess whether our synthetic control is appropriately balanced on pre-treatment differences. As we saw above, we matched on both time-varying and non time-varying covariates. Looking at the balance table below we see that we achieved <em>exact</em> balance on all our variables - which is quite good! This should give us more confidence that the outcomes we observe in the post period are due to the intervention, and not a result of systematic differences between treated and control units.</p>

<p>We can print out the results as well. Here we see that the observed number of assaults and robberies in the post-period were 77 and 53 for the 47th precinct, and 77.7 and 73.5 for the synthetic control, respectively. In the case of robbery we estimate that Operation Impact resulted in about a 28% decrease in robberies for the 3-month period in 2014.</p>

<p>It’s also helpful to visualize what this looks like. Looking at the results we see that most of the decrease in robberies occurred immediately after the start of the program. For assaults there’s a slight dip early on, but the overall results are more mixed.</p>

  <title>Generating Spatial Risk Features using R</title>
  <dc:creator>Gio Circo, Ph.D.</dc:creator>

<section id="spatial-features" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spatial-features">Spatial Features</h2>
<p>In criminology there is a considerable research on the role that fixed spatial features in the environment have on crime. These spatial risk factors have criminogenic qualities that make them “attractors” or “generators”<span class="citation" data-cites="brantingham1995criminality">(Brantingham and Brantingham 1995)</span>. Absent some change, these places typically contribute a disproportionate share of crime that is largely stable over time<span class="citation" data-cites="sherman1989hot">(Sherman, Gartin, and Buerger 1989)</span>. The classic example is a bar or night club. Alcohol plays a large role in a lot of crime, and locations where many people congregate and become intoxicated also have higher incidences of crime. We can use information about the environment to help solve problems or prioritize patrol areas.</p>
<p>One challenge in research is obtaining the point locations for these features. Generally when we perform some kind of spatial analysis we have a study area (e.g.&nbsp;a city or other boundary file) and a set of labeled point features corresponding to the locations of interest. However, reliable places to get this information is often hard to come by. Some cities provide open data portals with commercial information, but these are typically limited to larger cities. In my work I’ve had people ask how to get spatial risk factors for their research, often times for something related to the “Risk Terrain Modeling” approach of spatial analysis. I’ve worked on a few projects now where I’ve had to generate these myself, and have had some success using open data sources like Google to help with it.</p>

<section id="querying-google-places" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="querying-google-places">Querying Google Places</h2>
<p>Google has a lot of paid API services which are quite useful for researchers. In most cases there is a free tier, and for smaller one-off projects this makes their API services attractive for research. Let’s walk through an example of how we might do this. For our example we will use the Swedish city of Malmö (which, incidentially is a very lovely city I’ve been lucky enough to visit). We have a shapefile that looks like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<div>
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://gmcirco.github.io/blog/posts/rtm-spatial/rtm_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="672"></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Our goal is to query the<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview"><strong>Google Places API</strong></a> to get the locations of criminogenic spatial risk factors (here, bars and gas stations). One significant limitation with the Google Places API is that there is a limit to the number of locations that will show up for a single query. This means if you ran the query on the entire city, it would only return up to 20 locations. However, we can bypass this by running multiple queries on smaller spatial regions. Other bloggers have provided similar advice as well (see <a href="https://blog.apify.com/google-maps-how-to-overcome-google-api-limit-120-places/"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://andrewpwheeler.com/2021/06/20/using-google-places-api-in-criminology-research/"><strong>here</strong></a>).</p>
<p>To do the actual interfacing with the Google Places API we will use the very handy <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleway/vignettes/googleway-vignette.html"><strong>googleway</strong></a> package.</p>

<p>We can divide the city into a series of grids, then iterate through each grid cell and query within it. This way we are more likely to obtain all of the relevant features in that grid cell without hitting the limit. Here, I create 150 1200 square meter grid cells, which gives us something like this:</p>

<p>In addition we extract the X-Y coordinates for the grid centroid, which we will use as our location for the API query. This means we hit the API 150 times, once for each grid cell. This is well within the free number that Google allows.</p>

<p>We can use the code above to iterate through each grid cell, hit the API, and then store the results in a list. I include a few helper functions to assist with pulling out the names and coordinates, binding them into a dataframe, and setting them up to export. The key bit of code is below, which is the part that queries the API for each of the grid cells:</p>

<p>Now that we have our city boundary and our spatial risk factors, all we need to do now is compute the distance from each grid cell to its nearest risk factor. In the end, what we will want is a dataframe with grid cell ids, and columns corresponding to distance to the nearest feature. After merging them, we can create a nice map like this - showing the location sand distances of our risk factors.</p>

<p>You can then use these features in other kinds of spatial risk models (for a great walk through, see <span class="citation" data-cites="wheeler2021mapping">(Wheeler and Steenbeek 2021)</span>.The big advantage of this approach is that you have the flexibility to implement any kind of model you want at this point - whether it is a conventional RTM model, or a <a href="https://github.com/gmcirco/quickGrid"><strong>boosted tree model</strong></a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="good-mythical-morning---a-whole-lotta-food">Good Mythical Morning - A Whole Lotta Food</h2>
<p>So, its no secret that my wife and I are fans of Rhett and Link’s YouTube series Good Mythical Morning. Specifically, we are fans of the large variety of food- related content like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc4t66r54dU">Will it Burger?</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOO6Rk9XLE8">Worst Halloween Candy Taste Test</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbAzAIvifkg&amp;list=PLJ49NV73ttrvzyYLLkhoyqe51ptzxCROA">International Burger King Taste Test</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHwpBQAx9KA&amp;list=PLJ49NV73ttrsJeC5lFgHADqyxWXB38yfd&amp;index=40">100 Years of Party Snacks Taste Test</a>.</p>
<p>While normally this would qualify as pretty generic YouTube content, Good Mythical Morning keeps it interesting by “gamifying” many of these segments. These including making the hosts try gross food mash-ups, throw darts at a map to guess the food’s country of origin, or use a shuffleboard to guess the decade the food originated from.</p>
<p>One of the games that is common on the channel is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sNBAoPYWKQ&amp;list=PL4x0ymuK0TYmmnGS6ZxX1TGckBToxiuWt">Blind Taste Test</a> where Rhett and Link are presented with food items from different fast food or restaurant chains, and are tasked with guessing which items come from which location. For example, in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=8MK4DK1lgdE&amp;t">Blind Chicken Nugget Taste Test</a> they are given nuggets from 6 locations (McDonalds, Wendys, Chic-Fil-A, Hardees, KFC, and Frozen Tyson Nuggets) and have to try and place them based on taste alone. It’s silly content, but fun.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-good-are-they">How Good Are They?</h2>
<p>One nagging question I’ve always had is whether their performance on these segments were any better than if they just randomly guessed each time. Blind taste-testing is actually very hard, and distinguishing between 6 different pieces of mass-produced fried meat is probably even harder. Indeed, their performance on a lot of these segments is actually not great. To answer this, I gathered data from all the blind fast food taste tests that I could find, and collected it into a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P_LIZnnnaoCZHwmmrBM3O26sPAGCekVj_3qmWyyxTpc/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet</a>. Most of the games have 6 options, but a few have 5. For simplicity I will focus on the 26 segments where there were six choices available.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, based on the 26 games that I collected, Rhett and Link have <em>the exact same number of correct guesses</em>. We can see, however, that their distributions are quite different (Rhett has a single game with all 6 right, and several with 4 correct, but also many more games with none correct). As expected, across all games we see their average is about 1.9 correct answers. Now, recall, our question here is “is Rhett and Link’s performance better than chance alone?”</p>

<section id="random-guessing-with-replacement" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="random-guessing-with-replacement">Random Guessing With Replacement</h3>
<p>So if we want to compare their performance to “chance” - that is, totally random guessing - we need a probability distribution. Here, the binomial is logical starting point. Let’s start with the simplest assumption of randomly guessing one of the six options <em>with replacement</em> (meaning you can guess the same option twice). While this doesn’t necessarily seem like an ideal strategy, Rhett and Link often do guess the same location two or three times.</p>
<p>We can use the probability density function for the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of guessing between 0 and 6 items correctly, where each trial is assumed to be independent. Below, we see that there is about a 67% probability of guessing at least one of the items correctly, and a 40% chance of getting exactly one correct. Getting more than 4 correct is very rare. If we look at the observed results above, we see this mostly matches up. Both Rhett and Link rarely get more that 3 correct.</p>

<p>Now, another strategy might be randomly guess, but not repeat any previous guesses. Instead of the guesses being independent, they are now dependent on prior guesses. That means we need to use a different method to calculate this. The hypergeometric distribution is commonly used to calculate this (e.g.&nbsp;<code>dhyper()</code>). This also falls within the realm of permutation-based math ala <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2195572/how-do-i-find-the-probability-of-one-correct-guess-when-matching-elements">derangements</a>. However, I am a simple man with a good computer and a less-good maths background, so I will simply simulate it.</p>

<p>Here we see that if we limit our guesses to only options not previously guessed, there is a roughly equal probability of getting between 0 and 1 answers correct, and about a 28% chance of getting more than 1 correct. Note, under this strategy it is not possible to get 5 answers correct (because if you incorrectly order at least one item, by definition at least one other item is also incorrectly ordered)</p>

<p>The expected value of random guessing in both scenarios is, approximately 1, meaning that Rhett and Link’s scores of 1.8 mean that, on average, they perform marginally better than if you guessed completely at random. This is on the order of about 1 additional item correct compared to just guessing 100% randomly.</p>

  <title>Building an Outlier Ensemble from ‘Scratch’</title>

<section id="part-3-the-histogram-based-anomaly-detector" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-3-the-histogram-based-anomaly-detector">Part 3: The histogram-based anomaly detector</h2>
<p>This is the third part of a 3-part series. In the first two posts I described how I built a <a href="https://gmcirco.github.io/blog/posts/pca-anomaly/pca_anomaly.html">principal components analysis anomaly detector</a> and a k-nearest neighbors anomaly detector as components for a ensemble model. This third post will discuss the last piece, which is a histogram-based anomaly detector.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Soft” principal components anomaly detector</li>
<li>K-nearest neighbors anomaly detector</li>
<li><strong>Isolation forest or histogram-based anomaly detector</strong></li>
</ol>

<section id="defining-sub-space-density" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="defining-sub-space-density">Defining sub-space density</h3>
<p>The core of the idea behind a histogram-based outlier detector is that it is a method to efficiently explore subspaces of the data by binning observations into discrete groups, then weighting each bin inversely by the number of observations (more on this in a moment). To start, we can provide a quick example showing how we can use histograms to partition the data into bins. Below, I create two histograms for the features representing stay length and average cost per-stay.</p>

<p>If we plot each of these histograms, we can observe that most values concentrate in a few bins, while a small number of values are in more sparsely-populated bins. Obviously this shows us that the majority of stay lengths are between 0-10 days, and the average cost per-stay is around $4,000.</p>

<p>We can plot this in 2 dimensions to see how the feature space distribution is subdivided based on histogram bins. As we would expect, the majority of observations fall into a few regions, while potential outliers exist in much more sparsely populated bins. This is actually fairly similar to a decision tree, where we classify observations based on a set of rules. For example, the lone observation on the far right of the plot is in a region where <code>stay_length &gt;= 44</code> and <code>cost_per_stay &gt;= 3367</code> and <code>cost_per_stay &lt;= 4837</code>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scoring-observations">Scoring observations</h3>
<p>With this in mind, we are essentially going to do the above, but in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> dimensions (where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> is the number of input features). To give each observation an anomaly score, we will follow a <a href="https://www.goldiges.de/publications/HBOS-KI-2012.pdf">very simple scoring mechanism</a> proposed by the original authors of the method where:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?HBOS(p)%20=%20%5Csum%5Ed_%7Bi=0%7Dlog(%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bhist_i(p)%7D)"> Which states that the histogram-based anomaly score is the sum of the log of inverse histogram densities. More simply, for each feature <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> we compute a histogram density, and each observation is scored based on the inverse of its bin density <span class="citation" data-cites="goldstein2012histogram">(Goldstein and Dengel 2012)</span>. This means observations in sparsely populated bins receive higher scores, and vice-versa. One of the trade-offs here is that we have to assume feature independence (which is a tenuous assumption in a lot of cases), but even violations of this might not be <em>too</em> bad.</p>

<section id="a-brief-aside-choosing-the-optimal-bin-size" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-brief-aside-choosing-the-optimal-bin-size">A brief aside: choosing the optimal bin size</h3>
<p>One challenge with this approach is that before we calculate histogram densities we need to define the number of bins for our histograms ahead of time. Now, one simple method might just be to choose a very rough rule-of-thumb (e.g.&nbsp;the “Sturges” rule of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1+log2(N)">) or to just choose a constant number like 5 or 10. A more principled way, however, would be to derive the optimal number of bins based on some properties of the input data.</p>
<p>There are a lot of proposed options out here, but the one that makes a lot of sense to me (and, incidentally, is also used in the <a href="https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/pyod/models/hbos.html">pyod</a> implementation of this function) is to iteratively fit histograms, calculate a <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/10.1051/ps:2006001.pdf">penalized maximum likelihood</a> estimate for each histogram <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">, and then select the number of bins corresponding to the maximum likelihood estimate <span class="citation" data-cites="birge2006many">(Birgé and Rozenholc 2006)</span>. A rough R implementation of this is shown below:</p>

<p>With the issue of histogram bins out of the way, we can procede with the rest of the model. The last bit is really quite simple. For each feature <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> we compute the optimal number of bins (using the function we just defined above). We then build a histogram for that feature and identify which points fall within each bin. We then score each point according to the formula above, which is the log of the inverse histogram density (making outlying observations have correspondingly <em>higher</em> anomaly scores). The last thing we do after running this algorithm over all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> features is to scale their scores (here, I use min-max normalization) and sum them together. The code to do this is below:</p>

<p>Now we’re ready to run everything. For simplicity, I wrap all this code into a single <code>adHBOS</code> function that contains the optimal histogram binning and the scoring (see: Section&nbsp;3.1). For flagging anomalies we will just identify the highest 5% (a rough, but arguably acceptable heuristic).</p>

<p>As we expect, most of the observations that are flagged as outliers reside in bins with few other observations. This is pretty consistent with the other two methods we used before (PCA and KNN anomaly detectors). One specific advantage of the HBOS method is that it is very fast for even large datasets. However, with higher levels of dimensionality it is very likely that the assumption of feature independence is tenuous at best. Other methods, like the isolation forest can often perform better in higher dimensions. However, the simplicity of the method makes it easy to explain, which can be a benefit in many cases!</p>
