    "text": "Fitting A Bayesian Model\nWe’re employing an ordinal regression model with a cumulative link function, which is a typical method for analyzing Likert-style data. Gender remains constant across all coffee categories, while we permit the effects of age and expertise to differ for each type of coffee. Essentially, this suggests that we assume broader gender differences for all coffees, while acknowledging that the effects of age and expertise may differ across various coffee types.\n\n# set reasonable priors\nprior &lt;- c(prior(normal(0,2), class = Intercept),\n           prior(normal(0,2), class = b),\n           prior(normal(0,2), class = sd))\n\n# hlm with varying slopes for expertise\n# and varying intercepts for age\nfit2 &lt;-\n  brm(\n    ranking ~ 1 + \n      gender +\n      (age + expertise | coffee),\n    data = coffee_ranking,\n    prior = prior,\n    family = cumulative(\"probit\"),\n    chains = 4,\n    cores = 4,\n    iter = 2000,\n    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.9)\n  )\n\nThere are a few divergent transitions after fitting, but that can be fixed by upping the adapt_delta parameter. In general I’m satisfied with the fit, as all of our Rhat values are equal to 1.00, and the Bulk_ESS and Tail_ESS look fine too.\nAfter fitting the model, we can get some initial insights by plotting out some of the model coefficients. Specifically, we probably want to focus our attention on the varying effects for age and expertise on coffee preferences. We can do this by extracting the random effects from the model and plotting them. Here, we can see the estimated effect of age on preferences for each coffee (relative to the 18-24 group).\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of age on coffee preferences. Older individuals tend to rate coffee D lower.\n\n\n\n\n…and the effect of self-reported expertise:\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of expertise on coffee preferences. Individuals with higher expertise tend to rate coffee ‘A’ and ‘D’ higher.\n\n\n\n\nFrom this we see results that largely fit with what was reported in the video. Older people tend to dislike Coffee ‘A’ and ‘D’ more, and people with higher expertise tend to like them more.\n\nDigging a little deeper: Males vs. Females\nLet’s start by looking at all the predicted rankings for coffee ‘D’. In this case we have 500 different predictions, corresponding to all possible age x gender x expertise x ranking combinations. Each individual line represents the estimated ranking for a particular consumer.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictions for all consumer groups. Each line represents a single age, gender, and expertise combination.\n\n\n\n\nUsing this data we can do some simple comparisons. For example: what is the estimated difference between males and females ranking coffee ‘D’? In his summary, James Hoffman highlighted that females were much more likely to strongly dislike coffee ‘D’ relative to males. However, if you look at the data, females in the survey also generally reported much less expertise in coffee.\nSo what if we control for expertise, and see what the estimated difference in gender is assuming they are otherwise comparable coffee consumers. Below, we set the expertise for predictions to the median, which is 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Coffee rankings for males and females, across all age groups\n\n\n\nAnd here are the estimates for males and females, holding age constant at 25-34 and self-reported expertise to the median (6). As we can see both males and females with similar expertise within the same age groups largely rate coffee D similarly, with the largest difference being for ranking it a 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of gender on preferences for coffee ‘D’ holding age constant to 25-34.\n\n\n\n\nSo really, there aren’t very large difference in regards to gender after we control for expertise. The large gender difference that James sees in the survey is likely mostly an artifact of differences in experience with coffee between males and females1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale respondents were less likely to report high expertise with coffee, relative to males.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, if we look at the differences in self-reported expertise we have estimated rankings for a male, aged 25-34 for self-reported expertise at 1, 5, and 10. As is fairly clear, the distribution of estimated rankings is substantially different across levels of expertise. For example, we estimate about an 80% probability that a person with a self-assessed expertise of 10 to rate coffee ‘D’ a 4 or 5. In contrast that drops to about 45% for a person with an expertise of 5, and 20% for a person with an expertise of 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of expertise on preferences for coffee ‘D’ holding age and gender constant to 25-34 and male. Persons with higher coffee expertise are more likely to rate coffee ‘D’ higher.\n\n\n\n\nIf it’s not already clear, the biggest differences in rating the unusual natural-process coffee is not really related to gender, but rather it is mostly based on an individuals expertise or ‘expertise’ with coffee."

    "text": "Comparing two hypothetical consumers\nSo now that we have our model, we can use it to pose any number of comparisons by relying on posterior draws.\nLet’s first look at the most common age-gender-expertise combinations. Below we see that males largely make up the most common individuals who completed the survey. From a hypothetical perspective, let’s compare how the most common male respondent (between 25-34 years old with an expertise of 7) would rate a given coffee compared to the most common female respondent (25-34 with an expertise of 5).\n\n\nCode\ncoffee_data %&gt;%\n  count(age,gender,expertise) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:10) %&gt;%\n  kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nage\ngender\nexpertise\nn\n\n\n\n\n25-34 years old\nMale\n7\n383\n\n\n25-34 years old\nMale\n6\n305\n\n\n25-34 years old\nMale\n8\n199\n\n\n35-44 years old\nMale\n7\n168\n\n\n25-34 years old\nMale\n5\n159\n\n\n35-44 years old\nMale\n6\n159\n\n\n35-44 years old\nMale\n8\n114\n\n\n25-34 years old\nFemale\n5\n84\n\n\n25-34 years old\nMale\n4\n81\n\n\n25-34 years old\nFemale\n6\n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we need to compute 4000 posterior draws for each hypothetical user. These will be probabilities for our hypothetical person scoring a given coffee a 1 though a 5. We can get this by calling the posterior_epred function.\n\n# get 4000 posterior draws for two hypothetical individuals\n# for scoring a given coffee\n\n# helper function for generating predictions\nmake_comparisons &lt;-\n  function(fit,\n           pred_coffee,\n           pred_exp,\n           pred_age,\n           pred_gender) {\n    newdata &lt;-\n      data.frame(\n        expertise = pred_exp,\n        age = pred_age,\n        gender = pred_gender,\n        coffee = pred_coffee\n      )\n    \n    return(posterior_epred(fit2, newdata = newdata))\n  }\n\n# get posterior draws\nZ &lt;-\n  make_comparisons(\n    fit2,\n    pred_coffee = c(\"pref_d\"),\n    pred_exp = c(7, 5),\n    pred_age = \"25-34\",\n    pred_gender = c(\"Male\", \"Female\")\n  )\n\n# matrix of estimated differences\n# p1 - p2\np_diff &lt;- Z[, 1, 1:5] - Z[, 2, 1:5]\n\nThen we can put them into a dataframe and plot their distributions. As we can see, they are quite far apart. A 25-34 year old male with an expertise of 7 has a probability of about 35% of scoring coffee ‘D’ a 5, compared to 19% for female with an expertise of 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne nice thing about a Bayesian approach is that we have access to the full posterior, so we can compute any kind of comparisons. For example, what is the predicted median difference between these two individuals rating coffee ‘D’ a 5, with an 89% credible interval?\n\nquantile(p_diff[,5], probs = c(.06, .5, .94))\n\n       6%       50%       94% \n0.1386954 0.1519386 0.1651294 \n\n\nOr we can plot the estimated difference of males and females for each of the response categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr what if we had two consumers with similarly rated expertise, but one was much older?\n\nZ2 &lt;-\n  make_comparisons(\n    fit2,\n    pred_coffee = \"pref_d\",\n    pred_exp = 6,\n    pred_age = c(\"25-34\", \"55+\"),\n    pred_gender = \"Male\"\n  )\n\np_diff_2 &lt;- Z2[, 1, 1:5] - Z2[, 2, 1:5]\n\nquantile(p_diff_2[,5], probs = c(.06, .5, .94))\n\n       6%       50%       94% \n0.1952684 0.2140120 0.2323127 \n\n\nWhich suggests that the probability of a 25-34 year old rating coffee ‘D’ a 5 is about 21 percentage points higher than a 55+ year old individual. That’s a huge age difference!"

    "text": "For this post I rely on some data posted by David Johnson. He kindly made ATF gun trace data freely available here, which I learned about via a post on Twitter:\n\nGoing to have a new paper out soon that uses ATF gun trace data. Data is state level (2010-21) and has info on exported and imported crime guns … for example, exported crime guns are, from the context of FL, guns from FL but recovered in GA. Imported crime guns are guns from GA but recovered in FL.\n\nThe ATF data details the source of guns seized by the agency that were involved in crimes. This includes the state that the gun was originally registered in, the state that the gun was seized in, and the number of days from the date of registration to the gun’s involvement in a crime (a statistic referred to as “time to crime”). With this data we can examine flows of crime guns from their registered states to where they were eventually used in a crime.\nTo do this, I take the raw ATF files from the osf repository and process them in a little bit of code (see below). This code loops through the files from 2019 to 2021, strips off some unnecessary values, and then stacks them in a single data frame. We also do some basic computations to get the number and proportion of crime guns in a given state that were originally registered in another state.\n\n\nCode\n# params\nyears &lt;- c(2019,2020,2021)\nstate_recovery_list &lt;- list()\n\n# function to pull data from specific year\npull_data &lt;- function(year){\n  recoveries &lt;- read_csv(\n    sprintf(\".\\gun_recovery_%s.csv\", year)\n  ) %&gt;%\n    fill(REGISTERED_STATE) %&gt;%\n    filter(TIME_RANGE != 'Average Time-to-Crime in Years') %&gt;%\n    mutate(across(everything(), ~ str_replace(., \",\", \"\")))\n  \n  return(recoveries)\n}\n\nidx = 0\nfor(year in years) {\n  idx = idx+1\n  \n  # add state recoveries\n  state_recovery_list[[idx]] &lt;-  pull_data(year) %&gt;%\n    select(-TOTAL) %&gt;%\n    pivot_longer(c(-REGISTERED_STATE, -TIME_RANGE)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      value = as.numeric(value),\n      reg_state = tolower(REGISTERED_STATE),\n      recov_state = tolower(name),\n      year = year\n    ) %&gt;%\n    group_by(year, reg_state, recov_state) %&gt;%\n    summarise(guns = sum(value, na.rm = T))\n}\n\n# now combine\n\n# all recoveries\nstate_recoveries &lt;- do.call(rbind, state_recovery_list) %&gt;%\n  group_by(reg_state, recov_state) %&gt;%\n  summarise(guns = sum(guns))\n\n# recoveries from other states only\nstate_recoveries_else &lt;- state_recoveries %&gt;%\n  group_by(recov_state) %&gt;%\n  mutate(prop = 1 - guns/sum(guns)) %&gt;%\n  filter(reg_state == recov_state) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\nAll of this code above gives us two long-form data frames that define the number of crime guns seized in each state, compared to the state that gun was registered in. As an example, we can print out some values below:\n\n\n\nCrime Guns Recovered in Alabama\n\n\nRecovery State\nRegistered State\nCrime Guns\n\n\n\n\nalabama\nalabama\n16371\n\n\nalabama\nalaska\n1\n\n\nalabama\narizona\n59\n\n\nalabama\narkansas\n36\n\n\nalabama\ncalifornia\n430\n\n\nalabama\ncolorado\n77\n\n\nalabama\nconnecticut\n59\n\n\nalabama\ndelaware\n22\n\n\nalabama\ndistrict of columbia\n85\n\n\nalabama\nflorida\n1290\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, below we see that 16,371 guns were recovered in Alabama that were registered in Alabama, 1 gun that was registered in Alaska, and 59 that were registered in Arizona, and so on. We can also condense this table and find out the total proportion of crime guns that were registered in a state other than the state in which it was recovered:\n\n\n\nProportion of Crime Guns Recovered in Other State\n\n\nState\nCrime Guns\nProportion\n\n\n\n\nalabama\n16371\n0.170\n\n\nalaska\n1776\n0.154\n\n\narizona\n21908\n0.164\n\n\narkansas\n5957\n0.212\n\n\ncalifornia\n47192\n0.448\n\n\ncolorado\n10884\n0.288\n\n\nconnecticut\n1229\n0.560\n\n\ndelaware\n2325\n0.321\n\n\ndistrict of columbia\n196\n0.958\n\n\nflorida\n55685\n0.203\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove we see that about 17% of crime guns seized in Alabama were registered outside the state, about 15% in Alaska, and for every other state. We can use this information to get a more comprehensive look at the sources and flows of guns."

Data is state level (2010-21) and has info on exported and imported crime guns … for example, exported crime guns are, from the context of FL, guns from FL but recovered in GA. Imported crime guns are guns from GA but recovered in FL.\n\nThe ATF data details the source of guns seized by the agency that were involved in crimes. This includes the state that the gun was originally registered in, the state that the gun was seized in, and the number of days from the date of registration to the gun’s involvement in a crime (a statistic referred to as “time to crime”). With this data we can examine flows of crime guns from their registered states to where they were eventually used in a crime.\nTo do this, I take the raw ATF files from the osf repository and process them in a little bit of code (see below). This code loops through the files from 2019 to 2021, strips off some unnecessary values, and then stacks them in a single data frame. We also do some basic computations to get the number and proportion of crime guns in a given state that were originally registered in another state.\n\n\nCode\n# params\nyears &lt;- c(2019,2020,2021)\nstate_recovery_list &lt;- list()\n\n# function to pull data from specific year\npull_data &lt;- function(year){\n  recoveries &lt;- read_csv(\n    sprintf(\".\\gun_recovery_%s.csv\", year)\n  ) %&gt;%\n    fill(REGISTERED_STATE) %&gt;%\n    filter(TIME_RANGE != 'Average Time-to-Crime in Years') %&gt;%\n    mutate(across(everything(), ~ str_replace(., \",\", \"\")))\n  \n  return(recoveries)\n}\n\nidx = 0\nfor(year in years) {\n  idx = idx+1\n  \n  # add state recoveries\n  state_recovery_list[[idx]] &lt;-  pull_data(year) %&gt;%\n    select(-TOTAL) %&gt;%\n    pivot_longer(c(-REGISTERED_STATE, -TIME_RANGE)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      value = as.numeric(value),\n      reg_state = tolower(REGISTERED_STATE),\n      recov_state = tolower(name),\n      year = year\n    ) %&gt;%\n    group_by(year, reg_state, recov_state) %&gt;%\n    summarise(guns = sum(value, na.rm = T))\n}\n\n# now combine\n\n# all recoveries\nstate_recoveries &lt;- do.call(rbind, state_recovery_list) %&gt;%\n  group_by(reg_state, recov_state) %&gt;%\n  summarise(guns = sum(guns))\n\n# recoveries from other states only\nstate_recoveries_else &lt;- state_recoveries %&gt;%\n  group_by(recov_state) %&gt;%\n  mutate(prop = 1 - guns/sum(guns)) %&gt;%\n  filter(reg_state == recov_state) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\nAll of this code above gives us two long-form data frames that define the number of crime guns seized in each state, compared to the state that gun was registered in. As an example, we can print out some values below:\n\n\n\nCrime Guns Recovered in Alabama\n\n\nRecovery State\nRegistered State\nCrime Guns\n\n\n\n\nalabama\nalabama\n16371\n\n\nalabama\nalaska\n1\n\n\nalabama\narizona\n59\n\n\nalabama\narkansas\n36\n\n\nalabama\ncalifornia\n430\n\n\nalabama\ncolorado\n77\n\n\nalabama\nconnecticut\n59\n\n\nalabama\ndelaware\n22\n\n\nalabama\ndistrict of columbia\n85\n\n\nalabama\nflorida\n1290\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, below we see that 16,371 guns were recovered in Alabama that were registered in Alabama, 1 gun that was registered in Alaska, and 59 that were registered in Arizona, and so on. We can also condense this table and find out the total proportion of crime guns that were registered in a state other than the state in which it was recovered:\n\n\n\nProportion of Crime Guns Recovered in Other State\n\n\nState\nCrime Guns\nProportion\n\n\n\n\nalabama\n16371\n0.170\n\n\nalaska\n1776\n0.154\n\n\narizona\n21908\n0.164\n\n\narkansas\n5957\n0.212\n\n\ncalifornia\n47192\n0.448\n\n\ncolorado\n10884\n0.288\n\n\nconnecticut\n1229\n0.560\n\n\ndelaware\n2325\n0.321\n\n\ndistrict of columbia\n196\n0.958\n\n\nflorida\n55685\n0.203\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove we see that about 17% of crime guns seized in Alabama were registered outside the state, about 15% in Alaska, and for every other state. We can use this information to get a more comprehensive look at the sources and flows of guns."

    "text": "Gun Control and Crime Guns\nThe first thing we can do is visually assess which states have the greatest proportion of seized crime guns registered in other states. Visually, the map below has some fairly striking patterns. New England states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey all have very high proportions of crime guns imported from other states. In the Midwest we see Illinois is a bit of an outlier, wedged in between Wisconsin and Indiana. And out in the West we see California also has many crime guns imported from elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany states in New England, as well as Illinois and California, have a high proportion of crime guns registered in other states.\n\n\n\n\nIf we compare this map above to a map showing the number of restrictive gun laws passed (that is, any legislation that limits gun ownership, or repeals a previously permissive gun law) we see a fairly close overlap. California is noteworthy for having the largest raw number of restrictive gun legislation passed since 1990. States like Illinois, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Massachusetts also have much higher numbers of restrictive laws passed.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates in the South, Southwest, and Northern New England pass fewer restrictive gun laws relative to other parts of the county.\n\n\n\n\nSo does increased gun control cause the importation of guns outside that state? Well, a very basic comparison of the number of restrictive gun laws on the proportion of imported crime guns does seem to support that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the bottom-left corner there are a lot of states with relatively permissive gun laws who also import very few crime guns from other states. On the upper-right quadrant we see states with much more restrictive gun laws who have a much higher proportion of guns imported from other states. To be clear, this isn’t a huge revelation to many. There are a lot of studies showing how crime guns are imported through gun traffickers, out-of-state dealers, and straw purchasers (Cook et al. 2014) which bypass the restrictive state laws.\nWith this data we can also look at some state-by-state patterns to observe where these flows of guns originate from. Logically, we would expect to see guns purchased in more permissive states to flow to less permissive ones. Below we have some examples from Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts.\n\nIllinois\nWhile I currently live in Connecticut, my home state of Illinois has had a long history with gun violence. Despite having more restrictive gun laws compared to much of the country, gun violence has been a serious and ongoing issue.\nIndeed, it is not much of a secret that many guns used in crimes come from nearby states with less restrictive laws.Looking below we see that just under half of seized crime guns in Illinois are registered inside the state. Neighboring Indiana comprises about 17%, and then 5% and 4% from Missouri and Wisconsin, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of crime guns not registered in Illinois come from neighboring Indiana.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistered State\nCrime Guns\nProportion\n\n\n\n\nillinois\n18332\n0.488\n\n\nindiana\n6327\n0.169\n\n\nmissouri\n1961\n0.052\n\n\nwisconsin\n1489\n0.040\n\n\nkentucky\n1053\n0.028\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York\nIn contrast to Illinois, many crime guns are imported from much farther away. The so called “iron pipeline” represents the interstate flow of guns from Southern states with relatively lax gun laws to the more restrictive states in New England (Braga et al. 2012). In the map below it is quite clear that most of the out of state guns used in crimes come from Georgia, Virginia, and South Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ‘Iron Pipeline’ draws guns from South Atlantic states into New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistered State\nCrime Guns\nProportion\n\n\n\n\nnew york\n2982\n0.180\n\n\ngeorgia\n2133\n0.129\n\n\nvirginia\n1577\n0.095\n\n\nsouth carolina\n1453\n0.088\n\n\npennsylvania\n1228\n0.074\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassachusetts\nInterestingly, while Massachusetts has similarly strict gun laws as New York, most of the crime guns actually flow from New Hampshire and Maine. While these states lie near the cluster of states with more restrictive laws, both New Hampshire and Maine are much more permissive with gun ownership. Here, their proximity is likely a larger factor in the proportion of imported guns relative to New York.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime guns in Massachusetts come primarily from nearyby Maine and New Hampshire, as well as from the deep South.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistered State\nCrime Guns\nProportion\n\n\n\n\nmassachusetts\n1234\n0.268\n\n\nnew hampshire\n621\n0.135\n\n\nmaine\n394\n0.085\n\n\ngeorgia\n359\n0.078\n\n\nflorida\n330\n0.072"

    "text": "What Does This Mean For Gun Control?\nI’ve done a lot of work on guns and gun violence in my academic career. To be clear, I believe gun ownership is a right that many owners take quite seriously (indeed, I am a gun owner as well). However, it’s also clear that the proliferation of guns in the United States is a serious public health problem (Bauchner et al. 2017). Laws restricting gun ownership in many cases makes sense - for example among perpetrators of intimate partner violence (Zeoli, Malinski, and Turchan 2016). What is less clear is how we make this work in a country with a patchwork of laws and a highly politicized environment around gun ownership. While I think gun legislation is a key part of reducing the burden that gun violence plays in the US, I also think a more “holistic” approach is also needed to address other parts of the problem - like access to mental health and addressing concentrated disadvantage in many places. Given the environment we live in, simply passing more restrictive laws are unlikely to fix everything."

    "section": "Building a Histogram-Based Outlier Detector",
    "text": "Building a Histogram-Based Outlier Detector\n\nDefining sub-space density\nThe core of the idea behind a histogram-based outlier detector is that it is a method to efficiently explore subspaces of the data by binning observations into discrete groups, then weighting each bin inversely by the number of observations (more on this in a moment). To start, we can provide a quick example showing how we can use histograms to partition the data into bins. Below, I create two histograms for the features representing stay length and average cost per-stay.\n\n\nCode\n# define breaks\nh1 &lt;- hist(df$stay_len, breaks = 5, plot = FALSE)\nh2 &lt;- hist(df$cost_per_stay, breaks = 5, plot = FALSE)\n\n# append to dataframe\nhdf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(d1 = findInterval(stay_len, h1$breaks),\n         d2 = findInterval(cost_per_stay, h2$breaks),\n         space = paste0(d1,\"-\",d2))\n\n# Create a data frame with a grid of values for the predictor variables\ngrid &lt;- expand.grid(stay_len = seq(min(hdf$stay_len), max(hdf$stay_len), length.out = 10),\n                    cost_per_stay = seq(min(hdf$cost_per_stay), max(hdf$cost_per_stay), length.out = 10)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(d1 = findInterval(stay_len, h1$breaks),\n         d2 = findInterval(cost_per_stay, h2$breaks),\n         space = paste0(d1,\"-\",d2)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(space = ifelse(space %in% hdf$space, space, NA)) %&gt;%\n    fill(space)\n\n\nIf we plot each of these histograms, we can observe that most values concentrate in a few bins, while a small number of values are in more sparsely-populated bins. Obviously this shows us that the majority of stay lengths are between 0-10 days, and the average cost per-stay is around $4,000.\n\n\nCode\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(h1, main = \"Stay Length\", xlab = \"Days\", col = '#004488', border = 'white')\nplot(h2, main = \"Cost Per Stay\", xlab = \"Cost\", col = '#004488', border = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\nA histogram’s bins are proportional to the number of observations.\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot this in 2 dimensions to see how the feature space distribution is subdivided based on histogram bins. As we would expect, the majority of observations fall into a few regions, while potential outliers exist in much more sparsely populated bins. This is actually fairly similar to a decision tree, where we classify observations based on a set of rules. For example, the lone observation on the far right of the plot is in a region where stay_length &gt;= 44 and cost_per_stay &gt;= 3367 and cost_per_stay &lt;= 4837.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_tile(data = grid, aes(x = stay_len, y = cost_per_stay, fill = space), alpha = .6) +\n  geom_point(data = df, aes(x = stay_len, y = cost_per_stay), color = '#004488') +\n  labs(x = 'Stay Length', y = 'Cost Per Stay') +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\") +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n2D histogram partitioning of observations. Colored regions represent different bin partitions. Note the sparse regions at the top left and lower right quadrants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScoring observations\nWith this in mind, we are essentially going to do the above, but in \\(d\\) dimensions (where \\(d\\) is the number of input features). To give each observation an anomaly score, we will follow a very simple scoring mechanism proposed by the original authors of the method where:\n\\[HBOS(p) = \\sum^d_{i=0}log(\\frac{1}{hist_i(p)})\\] Which states that the histogram-based anomaly score is the sum of the log of inverse histogram densities. More simply, for each feature \\(d\\) we compute a histogram density, and each observation is scored based on the inverse of its bin density (Goldstein and Dengel 2012). This means observations in sparsely populated bins receive higher scores, and vice-versa. One of the trade-offs here is that we have to assume feature independence (which is a tenuous assumption in a lot of cases), but even violations of this might not be too bad.\n\n\nA brief aside: choosing the optimal bin size\nOne challenge with this approach is that before we calculate histogram densities we need to define the number of bins for our histograms ahead of time. Now, one simple method might just be to choose a very rough rule-of-thumb (e.g. the “Sturges” rule of \\(1+log2(N)\\)) or to just choose a constant number like 5 or 10. A more principled way, however, would be to derive the optimal number of bins based on some properties of the input data.\nThere are a lot of proposed options out here, but the one that makes a lot of sense to me (and, incidentally, is also used in the pyod implementation of this function) is to iteratively fit histograms, calculate a penalized maximum likelihood estimate for each histogram \\(D\\), and then select the number of bins corresponding to the maximum likelihood estimate (Birgé and Rozenholc 2006). A rough R implementation of this is shown below:\n\n  # internal function: compute optimal bins\nopt_bins &lt;- function(X, upper_bound = 15)\n  {\n    \n    epsilon = 1\n    n &lt;- length(X)\n    \n    # maximum likelihood estimate for bin\n    maximum_likelihood &lt;- array(0, dim = c(upper_bound - 1, 1))\n    \n    # rule of thumb for upper bound\n    if (is.null(upper_bound)) {\n      upper_bound &lt;- as.integer(sqrt(length(X)))\n    }\n    \n    for (i in seq_along(1:(upper_bound - 1))) {\n      b &lt;- i + 1\n      histogram &lt;- hist(X, breaks = b, plot = FALSE)$counts\n      \n      maximum_likelihood[i] &lt;-\n        sum(histogram * log(b * histogram /  n + epsilon) - (b - 1 + log(b) ^ 2.5))\n    }\n    \n    return(which.max(maximum_likelihood))\n  }\n\nSo, running this for the first feature stay_len, we get:\n\nopt_bins(df$stay_len)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the detector\nWith the issue of histogram bins out of the way, we can procede with the rest of the model. The last bit is really quite simple. For each feature \\(d\\) we compute the optimal number of bins (using the function we just defined above). We then build a histogram for that feature and identify which points fall within each bin. We then score each point according to the formula above, which is the log of the inverse histogram density (making outlying observations have correspondingly higher anomaly scores). The last thing we do after running this algorithm over all \\(d\\) features is to scale their scores (here, I use min-max normalization) and sum them together. The code to do this is below:\n\n# run HBOS\n  for(d in 1:d){\n    \n    h &lt;- hist(X[,d], breaks = opt_bins(X[,d]), plot = FALSE)\n    fi &lt;- findInterval(X[,d], h$breaks)\n    \n    hbos[[d]] &lt;- log(1/h$density[fi])\n  }\n  \n  # minmax scale feature vectors\n  hbos &lt;- lapply(hbos, function(x){(x- min(x)) /(max(x)-min(x))})\n  \n  # return score\n  return(apply(do.call(cbind, hbos), 1, sum))"

This is pretty consistent with the other two methods we used before (PCA and KNN anomaly detectors). One specific advantage of the HBOS method is that it is very fast for even large datasets. However, with higher levels of dimensionality it is very likely that the assumption of feature independence is tenuous at best. Other methods, like the isolation forest can often perform better in higher dimensions. However, the simplicity of the method makes it easy to explain, which can be a benefit in many cases!\n\nHBOS Anaomaly Detector: Example Function\nHere’s a minimal working example of the procedure above.

    "text": "It’s no secret that ensemble methods are extremely powerful tools in statistical inference, data science, and machine learning. It’s long been known that many “imperfect” models combined together can often perform better than any single model.\nFor example, in the M5 forecasting competition almost all of the top performers used some element of model averaging or ensembling. Indeed, the very foundations of some of the most commonly used tools in machine learning, like random forests and boosting, work by averging across many highly biased models to create a single more powerful model. The success of this method is relies on the fact that averaging across many high-variance models generally results in a single, lower-variance model. This is most evident in the idea of the “wisdom of the crowd”, where large groups of individuals are often better at predicting something compared to a single expert. However, one area which hasn’t received much attention is outlier detection. When we say “outliers” we’re generally referring to observations that are exceptionally unusual compared to the rest of the sample. A rather consise definition by Hawkins (1980) states:\nThis rather broad definition fits well with the general application of outlier detection. It can be used for identifying fraud in insurance or healthcare datasets, intrusion detection for computer networks, or flagging anomalies in time-series data - among many others. The specific challenge I want to address in this mini-blog is an ensembling approach for unsupervised outlier detection.

In this case we have 1831 observations with 21 variables, of which about 9.6% of them are considered anomalous. These are conviently labeled for us, where a value of 1 indicates an anomalous reading. If we fit a simple random forest classifier we see that it is trivial to get a very high AUC on the test data (let’s also not get ahead of ourselves here, as this is a toy dataset with a target that is quite easy to predict). Below we see an example of the fairly strong separation between the inliers and outliers. Our random forest works well in this case - giving us a test AUC of .99 and an average precision of .98. While this is an overly simple example, it does expose how easy some models can be (in many cases) when there is a definite target variable.\n\n\nCode\n# fit a random forest classifier\nrf = RandomForestClassifier()\nrf.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)\n\n# extract the predictions, calculate AUC\nrf_preds = rf.predict_proba(Xtest)[:,1]\n\neval_preds(ytest, rf_preds)\n\n\nRoc:0.997\nPrn:0.977\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsns.scatterplot(x = X[:,7], y = X[:,18], hue = y)\n(\n    plt.xlabel(\"Feature 7\"),\n    plt.ylabel(\"Feature 18\"),\n    plt.title(\"Cardio Scatterplot, Inliers and Outliers\")\n)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nScatterplot of inliers (0) and outliers (1), displaying strong separation"

    "text": "Unsupervised Outlier Detection\nLet’s talk about unsupervised outlier detection. Unlike the situation above in an unsupervised setting we don’t have the convenience of a set of labels identifying whether a given observation is anomalous or not. And because we’re lacking this ground truth, it makes things a lot more complicated for choosing both our model(s) and the parameters for those model(s). Let’s talk about why.\n\nHow do we select a best model?\nIn classic supervised learning we can choose a metric to optimize (say, root-mean squared error or log-loss), then fit a model which attempts to minimize that metric. In the simplest case, think about ordinary least squares. In that case we have a simple target of minimizing the sum of squared errors. We can validate the fit of the model by looking at evalution metrics (RMSE, R-Squared, standardized residuals).However, when we lack a way to identify if a given observation is anomalous or not we don’t have any meaningful way to know if one model is doing better than another.\nYou might also be thinking about optimizing a specific parameter in a model (like the number of nearest neighbors \\(K\\) in a K-nearest neighbors model) using some criterion that doesn’t rely on a target variable (like the ‘elbow’ method). However, optimizing this parameter doesn’t guarantee that the model itself is useful. Simply put, we’re often left groping around in the dark trying to decide what the optimal model or set of parameters is.\nLet’s consider this example: Say we’re looking at the same cardio dataset from above and trying to decide what unsupervised outlier detector we want to use. Maybe we’re deciding between a distance-based one like exact K-nearest neighbors (KNN) or a density-based one like local outlier factor (LOF). Let’s also say we’re agnostic to parameter choices, so we stick with the default ones provided by pyod.\n\n# initalize and fit using default params\nknn = KNN()\nlof = LOF()\n\nknn.fit(X)\nlof.fit(X)\n\n# extract the predictions, calculate AUC\nknn_pred = knn.decision_function(X)\n\neval_preds(y, knn_pred)\n\nRoc:0.686\nPrn:0.286\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# extract the predictions, calculate AUC\nlof_pred = lof.decision_function(X)\n\neval_preds(y, lof_pred)\n\n\nRoc:0.546\nPrn:0.154\n\n\nHere we see that the KNN model performs better than the LOF model - however we didn’t adjust any of the \\(K\\) parameters for either model. Because, in practice, we can’t see this, we don’t know a-priori which model or set of parameters will work best in a given case. This is in stark contrast to our first attempt when we could simply focus on decreasing out-of-sample bias."

    "text": "An Unsupervised Ensambling Approach\nSo, because we can’t easily decrease bias (due to the lack of ground truth values) what are our options? Well, as we saw above, there is a large source of variance implicit in these models. This variance can come from multiple sources:\n\nChoice of model. There is considerable variance in how different models perform under different kinds of anomolies. For example, absent some evaluation metric how do you meaningfully choose between KNN, LOF, or one of many other methods. The pyod benchmark page shows that many models perform quite differently under different types of dimensionality and outlier proportion.\nChoice of parameters. Almost all anomaly detection models have added uncertaintly based on the choice of parameters. For example, in K-nearest neighbors we need to specify the parameter \\(K\\). One-class support vector machines (SVM) are notoriously difficult to tune in part due to the number of parameters to choose (choice of kernel, polynomial degree, ect…).\n\nTherefore, in an unsupervised model our best option is to try to reduce the variance implicit in both the sources above. Rather than staking our whole model on a single choice of model, or a single set of parameters, we can ensemble over a wide number of choices to avoid the risk of choosing a catastrophically bad combination. Since we don’t have access to ground truth, this ends up being the safest option (and as we will see, generally produces good results).\n\nALSO: A regression-based approach\nFor this specific post I’m going to focus on an unsupervised ensemble algothrim proposed by Paulheim & Meusel (2015) and further discussed in Aggarwal & Sathe (2017). The authors dub this method “attribute-wise learning for scoring outliers” or ALSO. The approach we are going to use extends the logic of the ALSO model to an ensemble-based approach (hence ALSO-E).\nLet’s talk a bit about the logic here. The general idea of the algothrim is that we iteratively choose a target feature \\(X_j\\) from the full set of features \\(X\\). The chosen \\(j\\) value is used as the target and the remaining \\(X - j\\) features are used to predict \\(j\\). We repeat this for all features in \\(X\\), collecting the standardized model residuals at each step. We then average the residuals across all the models and use them to identify “anomalous” observations. In this case, more anomalous observations will likely be ones whose residuals are substantially larger than the rest of the sample. The beauty of this method is that for the modelling portion we can choose any base model for prediction (e.g. linear regression, random forests, etc…).\nTo avoid models that are very overfit, or have virtually no predictive ability, we define weights for each model using cross-validated RMSE. The goal here is to downweight models that have low predictive ability so they have a proportionally lower effect on the final outlier score. This is defined as\n\\[w_k = 1 - min(1, RMSE(M_k))\\]\nwhich simply means that models that perform worse than predicting the mean (which would give us an RMSE of 1) are weighted to 0, while a theoretically “perfect” model would be weighted 1. This gives us the added benefit of downweighting features that have little or no predictive value, which helps in cases when we might have one or more irrelevant variables.\n\n\nAdding an E to ALSO\nThe base algothrim above fits \\(X\\) models using all \\(n\\) observations in the data. However, we can extend this model to an ensambling method by applying some useful statistical tools - namely variable subsambling. The idea proposed by Aggarwal & Sathe (2017) is to define a number of iterations (say, 100), and for each iteration randomly subsamble the data from between \\(min(1, \\frac{50}{n})\\) and \\(min(1, \\frac{1000}{n})\\). This means that each model is fit on a minimum of 50 observations and up to 1000 (or, \\(n\\) if \\(n\\) is less than 1000). In addition, we randomly choose a feature \\(j\\) to be predicted. Combined, this ensambling approach makes a more efficient use of the available data and results in a more diverse set of models.\nTo my knowledge, there is no “official” implementation of the ALSO-E algothrim, and it is not present in any large libraries (e.g. pyod or sklearn). However the method is generic enough that it is not difficult to code from scrach. Using the notes available I implemented the method myself using a random forest regressor as the base detector. The code below defines a class with a fit() and predict() function. The fit() function handles all the subsampling and fits each sample on a very shallow random forest regressor. The predict() function does the work of getting the residuals and re-weighting them according to their CV-error. While my implementation is certainly not “feature complete”, it’s good enough to try out:\n\n\nCode\n# code to fit an ALSOe anomaly detector\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n\nclass ALSOe():\n    \"\"\" Initializes a regression-based outlier detector\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, N = 100) -&gt; None:\n\n        self.param_list = []\n        self.model_list = []\n        self.anom_list = []\n        self.wt = []\n    \n        self.N = N\n        self.std_scaler = StandardScaler()\n\n    def fit(self, data):\n        \"\"\" Fit an ensemble detector\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # standardize data\n        self.std_scaler = self.std_scaler.fit(X = data)\n        data = self.std_scaler.transform(data)\n\n        # fit N models\n        for i in range(0, self.N):\n\n            # define sample space\n            n = data.shape[0]\n            p = data.shape[1]\n            s = [min([n, 50]), min(n,1000)]\n\n            # draw s random samples from dataframe X\n            s1 = np.random.randint(low = s[0], high = s[1])\n            p1 = np.random.randint(low = 0, high = p)\n            ind = np.random.choice(n, size = s1, replace = False)\n\n            # define random y and X \n            df = data[ind]\n            y = df[:,p1]\n            X = np.delete(df, p1, axis=1)\n\n            # initalize RF regressor\n            rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10)\n\n            # fit & predict\n            rf.fit(X, y)\n\n            # add fitted models & y param to list\n            self.model_list.append(rf)\n            self.param_list.append(p1)\n\n    def predict(self, newdata):\n\n        \"\"\" Get anomaly scores from fitted models\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # standardize data\n        newdata = self.std_scaler.transform(newdata)    \n\n        for i,j in zip(self.model_list, self.param_list):\n\n            # define X, y\n            y = newdata[:,j]\n            X = np.delete(newdata, j, axis=1)\n\n            # get predictions on model i, dropping feature j\n            yhat = i.predict(X)\n\n            # rmse\n            resid = np.sqrt(np.square(y - yhat))\n            resid = (resid - np.mean(resid)) / np.std(resid) \n\n            # compute and apply weights\n            cve = cross_val_score(i, X, y, cv=3, scoring='neg_root_mean_squared_error')\n            w = 1 - min(1, np.mean(cve)*-1)\n\n            resid = resid*w\n\n            # add weights and preds to lists\n            self.wt.append(w)\n            self.anom_list.append(resid)\n\n        # export results as min-max scaled\n        anom_score = np.array(self.anom_list).T\n        anom_score = np.mean(anom_score, axis = 1)\n\n        # rescale and export\n        anom_score = StandardScaler().fit_transform(anom_score.reshape(-1,1))\n        anom_score = anom_score.flatten()\n\n        return anom_score\n\n\n\nFitting the model\nWith all this in mind, fitting the actual model is quite simple. As stated above, the ALSO-E approach is largely parameter free, which means there isn’t much for the user to worry about. Here we’ll just initialize a model with 100 iterations, fit all of the random forest regressors, then get the weighted standardized residuals. This whole process can be condensed into basically 3 lines of code:\n\n# Fit an ALSOe regression ensemble\n# using 100 random forests\nad = ALSOe(N = 100)\nad.fit(X)\n\n# extract predictions from the models and combine\n# the standardized outlier scores\nad_preds = ad.predict(X)\n\n\n\nEvaluating the predictions\nNow that we have the predictions, we can look at the distribution of outlier scores. Below we see a histogram of the ensembled scores which, to recall, are rescaled to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Therefore, the most anomalous observations will have large positive values. Consistent with what we would expect to see, there is a long tail of large residuals which correspond to the outliers, while the bulk of the data corresponds to a mostly “normal” set of values centered around zero.\n\n\nCode\nsns.histplot(x = ad_preds)\n(\n    plt.xlabel(\"Anomaly Score\"),\n    plt.ylabel(\"Observations\"),\n    plt.title(\"ALSO-E Anomaly Scores\")\n)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of anomaly scores. The characteristic long tail highlights potential anomalous observations\n\n\n\n\nWe can evaluate the performance of our method by bootstrapping the original dataset 10 times, then running our model on each of the boostrap replicates. This is because there is bound to be some degree of randomness based on the chosen samples and variables for each iteration. Averaging over the bootstrap replicates helps give us some idea of how this model might perform “in the wild” so to speak. Below I define a little helper function to resample the dataset, fit the model, and then extract the relevant evaluation metrics. We then loop through the function and put the fit statistics in a set of lists. For evaluation we’ll look at the averages for each set.\n\n# Bootstrap sample from base dataset and evaluate metrics\ndef boot_eval(df):\n    X, y = resample(df['X'], df['y'])\n\n    ad = ALSOe(N = 100)\n    ad.fit(X)\n    ad_preds = ad.predict(X)\n\n    auc = roc_auc_score(y, ad_preds)\n    pre = average_precision_score(y, ad_preds)\n\n    return [auc, pre]\n\n# run models\nroc_list = []\nprn_list = []\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    roc, prn = boot_eval(data)\n\n    roc_list.append(roc)\n    prn_list.append(prn)\n\nShown below, we see we have a decent AUC and average precision score of about 0.71 and 0.26 respectively. While this is substantially lower than the supervised model, it is still better than the base KNN and LOF models above. The ensambling process also makes it easy because we don’t have to specify any parameters other than the number of iterations to run. In testing, the default 100 works well as a starting point, and there aren’t huge performance gains by increasing it substantially.\n\n\nCode\nprint(f'Avg. ROC: {np.round(np.mean(roc_list),3) }\\nAvg. Prn: {np.round(np.mean(prn_list),3)}')\n\n\nAvg. ROC: 0.693\nAvg. Prn: 0.261\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing performance across datasets\nWe can also evaluate its performance on a variety of other datasets. Here I randomly chose another four datasets from the pyod benchmarks page and compared its performance over 10 bootstrap resamplings to the other benchmarked methods in the pyod ecosystem. Looking at the results we see that we get median RocAUC scores of between .7 to .85 and average precision scores between .2 to .85. For an unsupervised model this isn’t too bad, and largely falls within the range of other detectors.\nWe should note that while its performance is never the best, it is also never the worst either. For example: the .707 we achieved on the cardio dataset is lower than some of the best methods (in this case, PCA and Cluster-Based LOF). However, we avoid extremely bad results like with Angle-Based Outlier Detection or LOF. This underscores our goals with the ensemble model: we prefer a more conservative model that tends to perform consistently across many types of anomalies. We also avoid issues related to choosing optimal parameters but simply ensambling over many detectors. In an unsupervised case this decrease in variance is especially desirable.\n\n\nCode\n# load additional datasets\nd1 = np.load(\"C:/Users/gioc4/Documents/blog/data/Classical/14_glass.npz\")\nd2 = np.load(\"C:/Users/gioc4/Documents/blog/data/Classical/18_Ionosphere.npz\")\nd3 = np.load(\"C:/Users/gioc4/Documents/blog/data/Classical/20_letter.npz\")\nd4 = np.load(\"C:/Users/gioc4/Documents/blog/data/Classical/21_Lymphography.npz\")\n\ndlist = [d1,d2,d3,d4]\nmname = ['Cardio', 'Glass','Ionosphere','Letter','Lympho']\n\nroc_list_m = []\nprn_list_m = []\n\n# run models\nfor j in dlist:\n \n    for i in range(10):\n        roc, prn = boot_eval(j)\n\n        roc_list_m.append(roc)\n        prn_list_m.append(prn)\n\n\n# Plot evaluation metrics across datasets\nevaldf = pd.DataFrame({'RocAUC' : roc_list +roc_list_m, \n                       'Precision' : prn_list + prn_list_m,\n                       'Dataset': sorted([x for x in mname*10])})\\\n            .melt(id_vars = 'Dataset', var_name = 'Metric', value_name = 'Score')\n\n# facet plot across datasets\ng = sns.FacetGrid(evaldf, col = 'Metric', sharey = False, col_wrap=1, aspect = 2)\n(\n    g.map(sns.boxplot, 'Dataset','Score', order = mname),\n    g.fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.9),\n    g.fig.suptitle('ALSO-E Model Evaluation', fontsize=16)\n)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nensemble models often are often not as good as the best method, but can achieve consistently decent performance."

We have a shapefile that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to query theGoogle Places API to get the locations of criminogenic spatial risk factors (here, bars and gas stations). One significant limitation with the Google Places API is that there is a limit to the number of locations that will show up for a single query. This means if you ran the query on the entire city, it would only return up to 20 locations. However, we can bypass this by running multiple queries on smaller spatial regions. Other bloggers have provided similar advice as well (see here and here).\nTo do the actual interfacing with the Google Places API we will use the very handy googleway package.\n\nSplitting up into a grid\n\n\nCode\n# GOOGLE PLACES API CODE\n# ================================================= #\n# Giovanni Circo\n# gmcirco42@gmail.com\n#\n# Code to query google place api\n# Divides a boundry shapefile into grid cells\n# of radius r, then queries the api for each cell\n#\n# NOTE:\n# Only requires a free version of the API.

A: According to New York State law, parking between roadways on a highway is not permitted, except where official signs indicate otherwise.

    "section": "Coding Out a RAG Pipeline",
    "text": "Coding Out a RAG Pipeline\nIn a recent blog post I walked through a step-by-step process of how to set up a A/B testing process for prompt refinement. I relied on data from a recent DrivenData competition that used youth suicide narrative reports from the CDC’s National Violent Death Reporting System. I was pretty happy with the workflow I built out, but couldn’t help but feel that I could improve it somehow. The NVDRS has nearly 300 page coding manual with detailed instructions for each variable type. For example, section 5.5.9 describes the rules of how to code a death that is the result of a gang-related crime:\n\n5.5.9 Gang-related: CME/LE_GangRelated\nDefinition\nDefinitions for gang-related homicide can vary by law enforcement agency or CME and tend to capture\ndeaths that are classified as gang-motivated (i.e., the motive of the incident was gang-related) or had\nsuspected involvement of a gang member (i.e., a gang member was a suspect or victim in the incident).\nThis variable captures both types of gang-related deaths reported by agencies.\nResponse Options\n- 0 No, Not available, Unknown\n- 1 Yes, gang motivated\n- 2 Yes, suspected gang member involvement\n- 3 Yes, gang-related not otherwise specified\n- 4 Organized crime including motorcycle gangs, mafia, and drug cartels\n\nThere are nearly a hundred such rules in this manual. However, it doesn’t really make sense to try and pass the entire manual into our prompt. Even if the context window could handle the full size, when you are paying for tokens it makes sense to minimize the prompt to only the necessary bits. So what if we just wanted to augment each prompt with only the references that are relevant for the narrative being coded? This is where RAG comes in!\n\nEnvisioning a RAG pipeline\nThe way I envisioned this working was to process the RAG step separately by first indexing the relevant sub-sections from section 5 of NVDRS coding manual, which contains all information about incident circumstances. I would extract out the subsection chunks and then index them in vector database for retreval at the time of prompt creation. My prompt creator class already adds the headers, instructions, and questions to the final prompt, so all we need to add is the additional step of then tacking on the relevant rules from the vector database (see below):\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    %% Improved node styling\n    classDef input fill:#c4e3f3,stroke:#5bc0de,stroke-width:2px,color:#31708f\n    classDef process fill:#d9edf7,stroke:#5bc0de,stroke-width:2px,color:#31708f\n    classDef database fill:#dff0d8,stroke:#5cb85c,stroke-width:2px,color:#3c763d\n    classDef output fill:#fcf8e3,stroke:#f0ad4e,stroke-width:2px,color:#8a6d3b\n    \n    %% Main components with better descriptions\n    A[\"NVDRS Manual&lt;br/&gt;(Source Document)\"] --&gt;|\"Reference material\"| B\n    B[\"RAG Model&lt;br/&gt;(Retrieval System)\"] --&gt; D\n    C[\"Narrative Text&lt;br/&gt;(Case Information)\"] --&gt;|\"Contains: '...victim felt depressed..'\"| D\n    C --&gt; E\n    \n    %% Database and outputs\n    D[(\"Vector Database&lt;br/&gt;(Knowledge Store)\")] --&gt;|\"Retrieved: '5.3.4 Current depressed mood:'\"| F\n    E[\"Prompt Creator&lt;br/&gt;(Question Generator)\"] --&gt;|\"Generates: Q1, Q2, Q3\"| F\n    \n    %% Final output\n    F[\"Final Prompt&lt;br/&gt;(For LLM Processing)\"]\n    \n    %% Apply styles\n    class A,C input\n    class B,E process\n    class D database\n    class F output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my mind, I figured I could come up with a quick and dirty solution by using regex to hit on key words in each narrative, and then use a semantic similarity model (like SentenceTransformers) to retrieve the top \\(n\\) rules from the vector database. For example, a narrative might have a section stating:\n\n“Victim had been feeling depressed and sad in the days leading up to the incident”\n\nUsing regex we can grab the relevant words around our matched word (here, depressed), encode them, and then retrieve rules from the vector database. In the last step we append these to our prompt before executing it.\nThere’s just one problem - I’ve never done this before.\n\n\nVibe-Coding\nWhat is “vibe coding”? One of my favorite definitions comes from ex-OpenAI founder Andrej Karpathy:\n\n“There’s a new kind of coding I call”vibe coding”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists”\n\nIn short, it represents a programmer’s full surrender to the LLM, and taking what it gives back on good faith. When problems arrive, you just dig deeper and let the LLM guide you even further down the rabbit hole, trusting the process. I think the term is very funny - but there is a bit of truth to this. “Vibe-coding” is sort of what I used to do early in grad school when I was trying to get some esoteric model running in R with virtually no background knowledge. To me, vibe-coding harkens back to the days of panicked copy-and-paste from a variety Stack Overflow posts.\nWith this in mind, I believe in sharing my work. Here’s the full conversation I used to set up the RAG framework. I had enough of an idea of what I wanted, but wanted to speed up the processing of generating code required to get the document chunking and indexing working."

    "text": "Testing the RAG Process\nSo what did all that get us? Well, with the help of Claude we got a set of four functions that1:\n\nExtract the relevant pages from the coding manual.\nChunk up the pages into subsections based on headers.\nEncode these chunks using a SentenceTransformers model.\nSave the embedded chunks and the section indices in a vector database.\n\nas well as two others:\n\nA function to query and retrieve results from the vector database.\nA function to append the results into a prompt-friendly text object.\n\nI took the LLM-generated code and made some adjustments (maybe 10-15% or less) and then put them into their own .py file under my src folder. I then created a separate file index_rules.py to perform all the steps and locally store the vector database in a cache folder:\n\n\"Code to index rules from the NVDRS and store as vector store in cache\"\n\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader\nfrom src.rag import (\n    extract_pages,\n    chunk_by_subsections_with_codes,\n    encode_chunks,\n    create_vector_store,\n)\n\n# import the full nvdrs coding manual\n# we only need a subset of pages on circumstances\n# page 74 - 149\npage_min = 74\npage_max = 148\ncache_dir = \"cache/\"\n\nreader = PdfReader(\"reference/nvdrsCodingManual.pdf\")\n\n# extract pages, chunk subsections, then store in cache\n\npages_circumstances = extract_pages(reader, page_min, page_max)\nsection_circumstances = chunk_by_subsections_with_codes(pages_circumstances)\nsection_embeddings = encode_chunks(section_circumstances)\nindex, stored_chunks = create_vector_store(section_embeddings, cache_dir)\n\nWith that done, the other adjustment I needed to make was to add the ability to query the vector database and return relevant coding rules based on matching key words in the narrative. What I did was set up a dict containing key words for each major question, and a query term to append to the retrieved text substring. So, for example, given a narrative like this:\n\n“Victim was at home and complained about feeling sad and depressed. Victim had been treated for ADHD and bipolar disorder and had reportedly not been taking his medications in the days preceeding”\n\nWe would use a regex pattern to match 30 characters on either side of a matching keyword in the dict of keywords (one selected here below):\n\nkeyterms = {\n    \"DepressedMood\": {\n        \"Terms\": [\n            \"depressed\",\n            \"depressive symptoms\",\n            \"sad\",\n            \"unhappy\",\n            \"low mood\",\n            \"feeling down\",\n            \"persistent sadness\",\n            \"major depression\",\n            \"melancholy\",\n            \"hopeless\",\n            \"despair\",\n            \"gloomy\",\n            \"emotional distress\",\n            \"tearful\",\n            \"loss of interest\",\n            \"worthlessness\",\n            \"self-loathing\",\n        ],\n        \"Query\": \"Coding rules for DepressedMood\",\n    }\n\nWe then just loop through the dict of keywords and collect all the hits.\nTo illustrate: passing this example narrative into the search_vector_database performs the steps of searching for all regex hits, encodes the matching narrative text, and then queries it against the vector database. It then takes all of the results from the vector database search and passes these into another function that prepares it for insertion to the prompt. The create_prompt_rules function adds a header for the section for coding rules, and organizes them in order of section header. The code below shows a successful retreval for the DepressedMood variable:\n\ntest_narrative = \"Victim was at home and complained about feeling sad and depressed. Victim had told his partner that he was thinking about taking his own life.\"\n\nval, matched_variables = search_vector_database(test_narrative, 1, \"cache/rules_index.faiss\", \"cache/rule_chunks.pkl\")\nPROMPT_RULES = create_prompt_rules(val, matched_variables)\n\nprint(PROMPT_RULES)\n\n\nIf present, use the following rules to guide your coding of variables. Closely follow these instructions:\n    - Apply ONLY the rules relevant to the question\n    - If a rule is not relevant to the question, disregard it entirely\n    - Do NOT try and apply rules to questions where they are not closely relevant\n\n\n## RULES FOR DepressedMood:\nEvidence found: \"and complained about feeling sad and depressed. Victim had tol\"\n\nRULE 1 [Section 5.3.4]:\n5.3.4 Current depressed mood: CME/LE_DepressedMood \n \nDefinition:  \nVictim was perceived by self or others to be depressed at the time of the injury. \n \nResponse Options: \n0 No, Not Available, Unknown \n1 Yes \n \nDiscussion: \nOnly code this variable when the victim had a depressed mood at the time of injury. There does NOT \nneed to be a clinical diagnosis, and there does not need to be any indication that the depression directly \ncontributed to the death. Other words that can trigger coding this variable besides “depressed” are sad, \ndespondent, down, blue, low, unhappy, etc. Words that should not trigger coding this variable are \nagitated, angry, mad, anxious, overwrought, etc. \n \n If the victim has a known clinical history of depression but had no depressive symptoms at the time \nof the incident, this variable should NOT be selected. \n Depressed mood should not be inferred by the coder based on the circumstances (e.g., because the \nperson reports a bankruptcy); rather it must be noted in the record. \n \nManner of Death: All manners."

I added an extra parameter named include_rag that triggers the RAG process and appended it to the prompt if specified by the user:\n\ndef standard_prompt_caching(\n        self,\n        header: str | list = None,\n        narrative: str | list = None,\n        body: str | list = None,\n        example_output: str | list = None,\n        footer: str | list = None,\n        include_rag: bool | list = False,\n        **kwargs\n    ) -&gt; list:\n        \"\"\"Create multiple standard prompts based on all combinations of list elements.\n        This puts the narrative at the end to support OpenAI prompt caching.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # Ensure all inputs are lists for consistent iteration\n        if include_rag:\n            val, matched_variables = search_vector_database(\n                narrative,\n                2,\n                \"cache/rules_index.faiss\",\n                \"cache/rule_chunks.pkl\",\n            )\n            rag = create_prompt_rules(val, matched_variables)\n            params = [body, example_output, rag, footer, header, narrative]\n        else:\n            params = [body, example_output, footer, header, narrative]\n        param_lists = [\n            [item] if not isinstance(item, list) else item for item in params\n        ]\n\nThe final result looks like this, which is structurally almost identical to the non-RAG version I did before.

Note can be written or electronic. \n \nResponse Options: \n0 No, Not Available, Unknown \n1 Yes \n \nDiscussion: \n A will or folder of financial papers near the victim does not constitute a suicide note. \n \nSection 5. Circumstances  131 | Page  \n   \n If the record states the person left a note, you can infer it was a suicide note in the absence of \ninformation indicating that the note had some other purpose. \n A suicide note can be any essentially durable message; it does not have to be on a piece of paper. \nEmails, text messages, voice mail, or writing on any object (such as a wall or table) all qualify. Phone \ncalls do not qualify, as they are not considered durable (even 911 calls, because the decedent may \nor may not have known they were being recorded). \n A suicide note does not have to communicate that the person wants or intends to die. Notes that \nare written to warn others at the scene of the fatal injury that conditions may be hazardous or \ndisturbing may be included (e.g., “Call 911, do not enter garage” or “Carbon monoxide – do not \nenter”).  \n A text or electronic message sent right before the suicide occurred should be labeled a suicide note, \nif there was no time between the sending/receipt of the message and the suicide. If there was time \nto intervene, this should be coded as “disclosed suicidal thought or intent.” If the contents of the \nsuicide note are included or described in your source documents, summarizing this information in \nthe narrative is helpful to provide further context for the incident. If you choose to do so, do not \ninclude verbatim text and do not include identifying information, but a summary of what was said. \nThis information may be helpful in noting themes related to the suicide that go beyond standard \nNVDRS circumstances and are one of the only means of accessing the decedents’ thoughts about \ntheir suicide more directly. \n \nManner of Death: Suicide and undetermined deaths. \n \n \n\n\nRULE 2 [Section 5.7.4]:\n5.7.4 Recent Disclosed Suicidal Thoughts or Intent to Die by Suicide: \nCME/LE_SuicideIntentDisclosed \n \nDefinition: Victim disclosed to another person their thoughts and/or plans to die by suicide within the \nlast month. Disclosure of suicidal thoughts or plan can be verbal, written or electronic. \n \nResponse Options: \n0 No, Not Available, Unknown \n1 Yes \n \nDiscussion:  \nThis variable helps identifies suicides for which opportunities to intervene and prevent the death may \nhave been present near the time of the suicide. It is also useful for exploring the association between \nstated intent and actual death. \n \n Code as “Yes” if the victim had disclosed suicidal thoughts or plans to another person recently or \nwithin the last month, whether explicitly (e.g., “I have been thinking about suicide lately” or “I plan \nto go to my cabin with my gun and never come back”) or indirectly (e.g., “I know how to put a \npermanent end to this pain”). Include in the narrative any available details about whom the intent \nwas disclosed to, how long before the death the intent was disclosed, and what was said during the \ndisclosure. \n Code as “Yes” if there was opportunity to intervene between the time the person disclosed intent \nand the injury event. \no Do not code this variable if the victim disclosed the intention to kill him or herself only at the \nmoment of the suicide (i.e., when there was no opportunity to intervene to stop the \nsuicide). For instance, sending an email or text message right before the victim shot herself. \nThis would be considered a suicide note. \n Do not endorse this variable if the victim had talked about suicide sometime in the distant past but \nhad not recently disclosed a current intent to die by suicide to anyone. This would be coded as \n“History of disclosed suicidal thoughts/plans”. \n A separate suicide attempt by the victim within a month of the suicide should be coded as “Yes.” In \nthis case, “History of suicide attempts” should also be coded, “Yes.” \n The timing of when the victim disclosed the suicidal intent may be unclear (e.g., recently or some \ntime ago) or not mentioned. Please use the following rules to code these cases: \no Code “Yes” if the narrative states the victim “just” or “recently” told someone about his \nsuicidal intent. \no If the record indicates disclosure of intent, but is unclear about the timeframe (i.e., does not \nmention it all), code as “Yes.” \no LE or C/ME reports may be unclear about timing of the disclosure. If the record indicates \ndisclosure of intent in the past, but states that there was no disclosure for the current \nincident, do not code, instead use the “History of suicidal thoughts/plan/attempts.” \no If the victim disclosed suicidal intent “a long time ago,” “more than a month ago,” or in the \n \nSection 5.

Circumstances  82 | Page  \n   \n If a diagnosis is not on the code list, code “Other” and record the diagnosis in the text field, \n“MentalHealthDiagnosisOther.” \n Do not attempt to infer a diagnosis based on reading the symptoms. \n While it is acceptable to endorse “Mental health problem” based on the victim’s prescription for a \npsychiatric medication, please do not infer or code a specific mental health diagnosis based on the \nmedication. \n Please note that bipolar disorder may be referred to as “manic depression” or similar terms (e.g., \n“manic depressive”) in source documents. While these are outdated terms, please code these cases \nas “2 – Bipolar Disorder.” \n Obsessive compulsive disorder may be referred to as “OCD” in source documents. Please code these \ncases as “8 – Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.” \n Post-traumatic stress disorder may be referred to as “PTSD” in source documents.

There does not need to be any indication that the mental health \ncondition directly contributed to the death. \n \n Mental health problems include those disorders and syndromes listed in the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) with the exception of alcohol and other \nsubstance dependence (as these are captured in separate variables). \n Examples of disorders qualifying as mental health problems include diagnoses such as major \ndepression, schizophrenia, and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as neurodevelopmental \ndisorders (such as intellectual disability, autism, attention-deficit /hyperactivity disorder), eating \ndisorders, personality disorders, and organic mental disorders (such as Alzheimer’s and other \ndementias). \n Also indicate “Yes” if it is mentioned in the source document that the victim was being treated for a \nmental health problem, even if the nature of the problem is unclear (e.g., “was being treated for \nvarious psychiatric problems”). \n It is acceptable to endorse this variable on the basis of past treatment of a mental health problem, \nunless it is specifically noted that the past problem has been resolved. However, do not code this \ncircumstance based only on a positive toxicology test for psychiatric medications (such as \nantidepressants). There must also be some indication that the victim was actually being treated for a \nmental health condition, such as a current prescription, the report of a family member, etc. \n  \nAlso code: At least one Mental Health Diagnosis variable should also be coded if this is coded.

The ex-girlfriend stated she was speaking with the V on the phone and he made suicidal statements to her, while talking to the V the ex-girlfriend heard a loud noise in the background and the phone went dead, she then contacted 911. Police were contacted and they made a welfare check and was unable to reach the V at his residence. While speaking to the V's roommate the police started to search on a wooded path behind his residence. A handwritten note was discovered, it appeared to be a suicide note. The v was located hanging from one of the trees just off path.The V, a XX XX, died from asphyxia due to hanging.  The decedent was found during a welfare check requested by his ex-girlfriend.  The ex-girlfriend reported he had called her and told her \"he was going to kill himself\" and then she heard a loud noise.  She arrived at his home and his gun was missing so she assumed he shot himself.  He was found in the woods behind his home hanging from a tree.  A suicide note was found in the home.  The mother reported he suffered from depression, ADHD, PTSD, school problems and legal problems.  The mother reported an undiagnosed and untreated PTSD.  The decedent had witnessed his friend shot in front of him.  Since then he had \"gone down the wrong path\".  He struggled with alcohol and drugs.  The mother reported he was trying to turn his life around after the birth of his child, but was denied visitation rights due to his legal troubles.\n\n\n\n\nAnd the output:\n\n\nJSON Output\n\n\n\n{\n    \"DepressedMood\": 1,\n    \"MentalIllnessTreatmentCurrnt\": 0,\n    \"HistoryMentalIllnessTreatmnt\": 1,\n    \"SuicideAttemptHistory\": 0,\n    \"SuicideThoughtHistory\": 1,\n    \"SubstanceAbuseProblem\": 1,\n    \"MentalHealthProblem\": 1,\n    \"DiagnosisAnxiety\": 0,\n    \"DiagnosisDepressionDysthymia\": 1,\n    \"DiagnosisBipolar\": 0,\n    \"DiagnosisAdhd\": 1,\n    \"IntimatePartnerProblem\": 1,\n    \"FamilyRelationship\": 0,\n    \"Argument\": 0,\n    \"SchoolProblem\": 0,\n    \"RecentCriminalLegalProblem\": 1,\n    \"SuicideNote\": 1,\n    \"SuicideIntentDisclosed\": 1,\n    \"DisclosedToIntimatePartner\": 1,\n    \"DisclosedToOtherFamilyMember\": 0,\n    \"DisclosedToFriend\": 0,\n    \"InjuryLocationType\": 3,\n    \"WeaponType1\": 6\n}\n\n\n\nI didn’t ask for any reasoning or citations for the rules provided.

    "text": "My Take\nTo be honest, I was surprised that most of the Claude-generated code worked as well as it did. I had to make few substantial changes. The code to do the chunking, embedding, and indexing took maybe under 30 minutes for me to read through, edit slightly, and execute. Adding these functions into my existing workflow took under and hour - so maybe 90 minutes total from prompt to working RAG proof-of-concept. To be honest, totally wild. I could have figured this out on my own, but this was like half a day of work, compared to the week it would take me to do it solely by scratch.\nHere’s the rub - I think “vibe coding” can be helpful to jump start a project from nothing to a workable proof-of-concept. I do NOT think it is a good idea to rely 100% on AI-generated code without knowing what it is actually doing. Personally, I think its a good idea to get a working POC and then pick apart all of the functions and steps the LLM generated to understand whats happening. Blind coding can certainly be a “vibe” but I don’t think it is sustainable for real-world production-level code."

    "text": "What’s up with Prompts?\nI am still a relative novice to large-language models (LLMs) when it comes to non-trivial tasks (like asking ChatGPT to summarize an email). Applying these models for complex real-world tasks is not nearly as simple. In fact, I think applying LLMs to solve business-problems is still new enough that I am not sure how many people can claim bonda-fide expertise here. Regardless, in my work I’ve been increasingly asked to use LLMs to automate the processing of large volumes of free-form text and extract structured output. Luckily, this is one task that LLMs are actually well-suited for, unlike many of the very silly attempts to plug it in where it is clearly not useful.\nIn my ongoing work, I have learned a few things. One of the biggest is that LLMs are very sensitive to the prompt they are given. Often, it can be a matter of wording, question structure, or even where the prompt is placed relative to the input. A few of the LLM companies, like Anthropic, even have some interesting suggestions: like structuring long documents with XML tagging to block off important sections. Outside of some of these more esoteric suggestions, I’ve found that common good practice for creating LLM prompts generally follows these rules:\n\nBe extremely specific\nSpell out tasks using bullets or numbered points\nProvide examples\n\nThis could be as simple as the difference between:\n\n“Summarize this legal document”\n\nor\n\n“Summarize this housing contract in 3 to 5 sentences. Include a section with numbered bullet points for the costs.”\n\nOne gives much more latitude to the LLM to do whatever it thinks is right, compared to the other which has structure and key instructions. Generally you will get better results the less you let the LLM fill in the blanks on its own."

    "section": "Setting up a testing framework",
    "text": "Setting up a testing framework\nWith that in mind, let’s talk a bit about how I think about prompting.\n\nMy “mental model” of prompting\nWhen I think of a prompt, I tend to conceptualize it as containing a few key pieces:\n\nA role which defines the key tasks of the LLM and provides it some structure to its intended job.\nA header which contains some initial instructions guiding the next steps in the prompt.\nA body which has the bulk of the instructions, text, and other materials that make up the primary tasks of the prompt.\nAn example of what the intended output is supposed to look like. In a structured text extraction task, this would be the format of the json or other file I want created.\nAn optional footer that contains some final instructions. Often times I have found these useful to provide a list of things I definitively do NOT want the LLM to do.\n\n\n\nA python framework\nApplying this to an automated workflow in python can be pretty easily actually. Since we’re just working with text prompts, all I need to do is create a system that concats all the necessary pieces together in a way that creates a full prompt. Below I set up a class to help test multiple prompt versions in a somewhat quicker fashion than creating each one individually. My goal here is to have the ability to test many different prompts, in different configurations, without having to manually copy-and-paste these examples and store them. To accomplish this, I first built out a small prompt creation class:\n\n\nCode\nfrom itertools import product\n\nclass Prompt:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def prompt_concat(self, text_list):\n        \"\"\"Concat a list of text, dropping None values\"\"\"\n        output_text = \"\\n\"  .join(filter(None, text_list))\n        output_text += \"\\n\"\n\n        return output_text\n\n    def standard_prompt(\n        self,\n        header: str | list = None,\n        narrative: str | list = None,\n        body: str | list = None,\n        example_output: str | list = None,\n        footer: str | list = None,\n        **kwargs\n    ) -&gt; list:\n        \"\"\"Create multiple standard prompts based on all combinations of list elements.\"\"\"\n        \n        # Ensure all inputs are lists for consistent iteration\n        params = [header, narrative, body, example_output, footer]\n        param_lists = [[item] if not isinstance(item, list) else item for item in params]\n        \n        # unpack params, then pass to concat\n        prompt_combinations = product(*param_lists)\n        prompts = [self.prompt_concat(combination) for combination in prompt_combinations]\n        \n        return prompts\n    \n    def standard_prompt_caching(self,\n        header: str | list = None,\n        narrative: str | list = None,\n        body: str | list = None,\n        example_output: str | list = None,\n        footer: str | list = None,\n        **kwargs\n    ) -&gt; list:\n        \"\"\"Create multiple standard prompts based on all combinations of list elements.\n        This puts the narrative at the end to support OpenAI prompt caching.\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        # Ensure all inputs are lists for consistent iteration\n        params = [body, example_output, footer, header, narrative]\n        param_lists = [[item] if not isinstance(item, list) else item for item in params]\n        \n        # unpack params, then pass to concat\n        prompt_combinations = product(*param_lists)\n        prompts = [self.prompt_concat(combination) for combination in prompt_combinations]\n        \n        return prompts\n    \n    def unstructured_prompt(self, prompt_text_list: list[str])-&gt; str:\n        \"\"\"Create an unstructured prompt, given a list of text\"\"\"\n        return self.prompt_concat([prompt_text_list])\n\n\nAll this class really does is take text strings and pastes them together using my mental framework. The trick here is that you can pass in a list for any of the parameters, and then we use itertools.product() to create all the possible combinations. For example, passing in 2 versions of a header, body, and example would give you \\(2^3=8\\) different combinations of the prompts. Also, here I add a “narrative” field which will serve as the input text for each text narrative we will be extracting data from."

    "section": "Classifying Youth Suicide Narratives",
    "text": "Classifying Youth Suicide Narratives\nThe example problem here is based on a competition that was hosted by the CDC last year on DrivenData. The stated goal of the contest was to extract structured information from free-text narratives derived from police and medical examiner reports. The free text reports look something like this simulated example below:\n[Simulated Example]\n\nV was a YYYY. V was discovered deceased at home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. No medical history was documented in the report. According to V’s close friend and coworker, V had struggled with periods of severe anxiety but had never spoken about self-harm. V’s friend mentioned that several years ago, V had driven recklessly after a personal loss, but it was unclear whether it was an intentional act. On the night of the incident, V had been drinking and sent a message to a relative expressing regret and affection for them and other family members. Toxicology results confirmed the presence of alcohol. No additional details regarding the event were available.\n\nThe contest required taking the short narratives and extracting 24 different variables based on definitions from the national violent death reporting system. Most of these are binary indicators about specific behaviors observed in the narrative. Therefore, we need to create a prompt that will instruct our LLM to read the narratives, extract features based on the rules for each of the 24 features, then return the output back to us in a format that we can use for scoring.\n\nPrompt creation\nAs a demonstration of what this testing can look like, my idea is to run 4 different prompt versions using a sample of narratives and evaluate whether we can observe any improvement in performance based solely on the prompt. As a default the body and example output of my primary prompt looks like this:\n\nBODY1 = \"\"\"\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n    Closely follow these instructions:\n        - For each variable below return a 0 for 'no' and a 1 for 'yes' unless otherwise stated.\n        - If more than two answers are available, return ONE of the numbered values.\n        - Rely ONLY on information available in the narrative. Do NOT extrapolate.\n        - Return a properly formatted json object where the keys are the variables and the values are the numeric labels.\n        - Do NOT return anything other than the label. Do NOT include any discussion or commentary.\n\nVARIABLES:   \n    DepressedMood: The person was perceived to be depressed at the time\n    MentalIllnessTreatmentCurrnt: Currently in treatment for a mental health or substance abuse problem\n    HistoryMentalIllnessTreatmnt: History of ever being treated for a mental health or substance abuse problem\n    SuicideAttemptHistory: History of attempting suicide previously\n    SuicideThoughtHistory: History of suicidal thoughts or plans\n    SubstanceAbuseProblem: The person struggled with a substance abuse problem.

This is probably the absolute minimum you would need to get some useful output. That being said, there are at least two areas I think we can improve this baseline prompt:\n\nAdd detailed descriptions to each feature\nAdd “few shot” examples\n\nThe first one will have us spell out a bit more closely what we actually mean for each variable. For example we might turn this:\n\nDepressedMood: The person was perceived to be depressed at the time\n\ninto this:\n\nDepressedMood: The person was perceived to be depressed at the time - 1: Specific signs of depression were noted in the narrative (e.g., sad, withdrawn, hopeless) - 0: No mention of depressive symptoms\n\nThe first one is vague, and gives the LLM a lot of freedom to guess what “perceived to be depressed” means. In contrast, the second one asks only to mark it if there were specific mentions of depresion noted in the narrative.\nWe can also add “few shot” examples to the prompt. This just means we provide the LLM with a few examples of a narrative and output to give it a better idea of what we want. Here is a synthesized example of what this might look like using a simulated narrative:\n[Simulated Example]\n\n\nCode\nEXAMPLE_OUTPUT2 = \"\"\"\nHere is an example narrative and expected output:\n\nEXAMPLE NARRATIVE 1:\nOfficers responded at 0745 hours to a report of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The V was found in a bedroom with two acquaintances present, a gunshot wound to the left temple, and no exit wound. The V’s girlfriend stated he had been struggling with anxiety and depression, especially with the anniversary of his cousin’s suicide approaching. Before pulling the trigger, the V said, “You won’t believe me until I do it.” A .380 caliber firearm, a handwritten note, alcohol, and unidentified substances were found at the scene.\n\nEXAMPLE OUTPUT 1:\n{\n    \"DepressedMood\": 1,\n    \"MentalIllnessTreatmentCurrnt\": 0,\n    \"HistoryMentalIllnessTreatmnt\": 1,\n    \"SuicideAttemptHistory\": 0,\n    \"SuicideThoughtHistory\": 1,\n    \"SubstanceAbuseProblem\": 1,\n    \"MentalHealthProblem\": 1,\n    \"DiagnosisAnxiety\": 1,\n    \"DiagnosisDepressionDysthymia\": 1,\n    \"DiagnosisBipolar\": 0,\n    \"DiagnosisAdhd\": 0,\n    \"IntimatePartnerProblem\": 0,\n    \"FamilyRelationship\": 0,\n    \"Argument\": 0,\n    \"SchoolProblem\": 0,\n    \"RecentCriminalLegalProblem\": 0,\n    \"SuicideNote\": 1,\n    \"SuicideIntentDisclosed\": 1,\n    \"DisclosedToIntimatePartner\": 1,\n    \"DisclosedToOtherFamilyMember\": 0,\n    \"DisclosedToFriend\": 0,\n    \"InjuryLocationType\": 1,\n    \"WeaponType1\": 6\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n\nIf you want to see all of the propmpt versions, you can look at the script under src.prompts.py in the git repo for this post.\n\n\nRunning through ChatGPT\nTo test all variants of these prompts, I took a sample of 200 cases from the 4000 original narratives, and oversampled from rare categories to ensure I had at least a few examples for each variable (if you are curious, you can look at my uid_weighting.R script for how I did this). Using these 200 cases, I wanted to test the 4 different prompt types by running them through a ChatGPT LLM. Most of the work is handled using the code below, where I take each sample narrative, construct 4 prompts, then append them to a json request template. All of these 200 examples are appended into a jsonlist object, then bulk run in a batch using the OpenAI API. I use one of the cheaper models here, 4.0 mini, which is probably fine for testing purposes. I should also note that tokens are cheap. In a batch run with 1.7 million tokens, I paid 13 cents for the input tokens and 6 cents for the output tokens. I actually messed up the prompt caching for this test, but if I did it correctly it would be 50% cheaper.\nOne important note - I specify the output must come in the form of a json object by adding \"response_format\": { \"type\": \"json_object\" }. This is ChatGPT’s “json mode”, which is quite handy for this. Oftentimes the LLM might hallucinate an output that is not a valid json and break the workflow.\n\nfor row in narratives.iterrows():\n\n    # grab the unique id and text\n    single_narrative = row[1]\n    id = single_narrative[\"uid\"]\n    txt = single_narrative[\"NarrativeLE\"]\n\n    prompt_input = {\n        \"header\": HEADER1,\n        \"narrative\": txt,\n        \"body\": [BODY1, BODY2],\n        \"example_output\": [EXAMPLE_OUTPUT1, EXAMPLE_OUTPUT2],\n        \"footer\": None,\n    }\n\n    # create a prompt, pass in the text narrative\n    prompt_versions = prompt_creator.standard_prompt_caching(**prompt_input)\n\n    version_num = 0\n    for prompt in prompt_versions:\n        # now append to list\n        json_list.append(\n            {\n                \"custom_id\": f\"{id}_{version_num}\",\n                \"method\": \"POST\",\n                \"url\": \"/v1/chat/completions\",\n                \"body\": {\n                    \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n                    \"messages\": [\n                        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": ROLE},\n                        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt},\n                    ],\n                    \"max_tokens\": 500,\n                    \"response_format\": { \"type\": \"json_object\" },\n                },\n            }\n        )\n        version_num += 1\n\nAfter passing the jsonlist it takes about an hour to run using the cheapest batch service.

The model with the highest score was the one with both detailed variable descriptions and 3 scored examples. Overall, all of the models did pretty well given how little tweaking I did. The more interesting question is looking at how much quality really was impacted by different prompting styles relative to the general randomness we typically expect out of an LLM.\n\n\n\nPrompt Version\nF1 Score\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\n0: Baseline\n0.763\n0.824\n\n\n1: Add 3 few-shot examples\n0.775\n0.832\n\n\n2: Add more descriptions to features\n0.778\n0.837\n\n\n3: Add few-shot and more descriptions\n0.781\n0.839\n\n\n\nA solution: remember analysis of variance from your stats 101 course? We can actually use it here to see if there if there is non-zero variation in f1 score attributable to a change in prompts, relative to the variation in question type. Looking below we see, unsurprisingly, almost all the variation is explainable by the question type (meaning that differences in f1 scores are mostly based on the question type).\n\n\nCode\nres &lt;- with(results, aov(f1score ~ as.factor(model_ver) + as.factor(feature)))\nbroom::tidy(res) %&gt;% kable(digits=3)\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf\nsumsq\nmeansq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nas.factor(model_ver)\n3\n0.004\n0.001\n4.054\n0.01\n\n\nas.factor(feature)\n22\n0.584\n0.027\n76.276\n0.00\n\n\nResiduals\n66\n0.023\n0.000\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we break this down by question type and plot them out, the results are a bit clearer. Below I have the questions ordered based on their variance in f1 scores, so that questions that changed more often based on the prompt are nearer the top. Interestingly, a few questions see a large improvement from the baseline prompt to the more advanced one. DepressedMood has an f1 score of .5 on the original prompt, which increases to about .65 on the final prompt. We see similar results with SchoolProblem, FamilyRelationship, and Argument as well. Questions that were already doing quite good see virtually no change - like WeaponType1. The LLM has a very easy time identifying the weapon, because it is almost always clearly disclosed in the narrative (and is very often a firearm)."

In these previous examples I had applied hierarchical models to help adjust for these issues we commonly observe with rare events. Let’s work with the same data that Andy used in his example. First, we’ll load the OSHA data for 2021 and isolate just the warehouses in North Carolina.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(brms)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# load osha data\nosha &lt;- read_csv(unzip(\"C:/Users/gioc4/Dropbox/blogs/hlm_osha/ITA-data-cy2021.zip\"))\n\n# isolate NC injuries at warehouses\ninj_wh &lt;- osha %&gt;%\n  filter(naics_code == '493110',\n         state == 'NC') %&gt;%\n  mutate(inj_rate = (total_injuries/total_hours_worked)*2080)\n\n\nIf we plot the distribution of injury rates per-person work hour year we see that the majority of warehouses are quite low, and very few exceed 0.2. However on the far right we see a single extreme example - the outlier that is the Bonded Logistics warehouse.\n\n\nShow code\nggplot(inj_wh) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = inj_rate), \n                 fill = \"#004488\", \n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 20,\n                 linewidth =1.5) +\n  labs(x = \"(total_injuries/total_hours_worked)*2080\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorting by the top 10 we see that Bonded Logistics has an injury rate nearly 4 times the next highest warehouse. But they also have only a single employee who worked 1,686 hours that year! Is this really a fair comparison? Following what we already know, almost certainly not.\n\n\nShow code\ninj_wh %&gt;%\n  select(company_name, inj_rate, annual_average_employees, total_hours_worked) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(inj_rate)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:10) %&gt;%\n  kable(caption = \"Top 10 Warehouses, by Injury Rate\", \n        digits = 2,\n        col.names = c(\"Company\",\"Injury Rate\",\"Employees\",\"Total Hours Worked\"))\n\n\n\nTop 10 Warehouses, by Injury Rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\nInjury Rate\nEmployees\nTotal Hours Worked\n\n\n\n\nBonded Logistics\n1.23\n1\n1686\n\n\nTechnimark\n0.34\n4\n6154\n\n\nBonded Logistics\n0.30\n4\n6913\n\n\nCAPSTONE LOGISTICS, LLC\n0.29\n36\n43137\n\n\nRH US LLC\n0.27\n7\n7703\n\n\nAldi (N.C.)

We then partially pool estimates from the model toward the group-level means. In short, we’ll model this as the number of injuries \\(y\\) at each warehouse \\(j\\) as a Poisson process, where each warehouse is modeled with its own (varying) intercept. In a minute we will see the advantage of this.\n\\[y_{j} \\sim Poisson(\\lambda_{j})\\] \\[ln(\\lambda{j}) = \\beta_{0j}\\]\nUsing brms we’ll fit a Poisson regression estimating the total number of injuries at any warehouse weighted by the logged number of hours worked. Because the model is extremely simple, we’ll just keep the default priors with this model which are student_t(3,0,3).\n\n\nCode\n# fit the hierarchical model w/ default priors\n\nfit &lt;- brm(total_injuries ~ 1 + (1|id) + \n             offset(log(total_hours_worked)), \n           family = poisson(), \n           data = inj_wh,\n           file = \"C:/Users/gioc4/Dropbox/blogs/hlm_osha/brmfit\",\n           chains = 4, cores = 4, iter = 2000)\n\n\nAfter the model fits, it’s generally a good idea to make sure the predictions from the model correspond with the observed distribution of the data.

    "text": "Shrinkage!\nHere’s where things get interesting. One of the benefits of a hierarchical model is that estimates from the model are partially pooled (shrunk) toward the group-level means. In a typical no-pooling model, estimates from very sparse clusters can be extreme or even undefined. In our hierarchical example we are applying regularization to the estimates by trading higher bias for lower variance(Gelman et al. 1995). In a Bayesian framework our application of a prior distribution helps set a reasonable boundary for our model estimates.\nTo illustrate this, we can see the difference between the predicted (blue circles) and observed (empty circles) below. For warehouses with very few worked hours we see that the estimates are pulled strongly toward the global mean. For warehouses with more hours, however, there is considerably less shrinkage.\n\n\nShow code\n# predicted vs actual\ninj_wh_pred &lt;- inj_wh %&gt;%\n  select(id, company_name, inj_rate, annual_average_employees, total_hours_worked) %&gt;%\n  mutate(yhat = predict(fit, type = 'response')[,1],\n         inj_rate_pred = (yhat/total_hours_worked) * 2080)\n\n# Plot all values\nggplot(inj_wh_pred, aes(x = total_hours_worked)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(inj_wh_pred$inj_rate), linewidth = 1, color = \"#004488\", alpha = .7)+\n  geom_point(aes(y = inj_rate), shape = 21, size = 2)+\n  geom_point(aes(y = inj_rate_pred), shape = 21, fill = \"#004488\", size = 2, alpha = .5) +\n  labs(x = \"Total Hours Worked\", y = \"Total Injuries/Hours Worked\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we constrain ourselves to the left-hand side of the plot we can view this even more clearly. The estimated value for the unusual Bonded Warehouse is 0.1 compared to the observed value of 1.23. While this estimate is farther off from the observed value, it is probably much more reasonable based on the observed values of other warehouses.\n\n\nShow code\ninj_wh_pred %&gt;%\n  filter(total_hours_worked &lt; 1e5) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = total_hours_worked)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(inj_wh_pred$inj_rate), linewidth = 1, color = \"#004488\", alpha = .7)+\n  geom_point(aes(y = inj_rate), shape = 21, size = 2)+\n  geom_point(aes(y = inj_rate_pred), shape = 21, fill = \"#004488\", size = 2, alpha = .5) +\n  labs(x = \"Total Hours Worked\", y = \"Total Injuries/Hours Worked\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we compare the predicted injury rates to the observed ones, we can see the differences in shrinkage as well.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The logic behind the “retrieve and rerank” method is that we have two sets of tools that excel at one specific task. Specifically we want to use a combination of a bi-encoder and cross-encoder to retrieve data based on an initial input query. The trade-off we have to deal with is that cross-enocder models are very slow, while bi-encoder models have performance that often falls short for retreval purposes.\nThe bi-encoder model (the “retrieve” part) creates seperate embeddings of the input query and corpus text and looks for the closest match based on the vector space. This is often done by finding the nearest cosine similarity. The retreval step is typically quite fast, with the trade-off that some information is lost because the query and search corpus are embedded seperately.\nOn the flip side, a cross encoder embeds the search query and corpus together. The major advantage of this, is that the cross-encoder uses cross-attention to create the similarity score, which pools information about the both inputs directly. However, the major trade off is that this requires the search query to be embedded with every query-corpus pair. In a very large dataset, this might create millions of pairs and is can be potentially very slow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(\"Sentence A\") ==&gt; BA ==&gt; SA ==&gt; C\n  B(\"Sentence B\") ==&gt; BB ==&gt; SB ==&gt; C\n  BA[\"BERT\"]\n  BB[\"BERT\"]\n  SA[\"Sentence Embedding\"]\n  SB[\"Sentence Embedding\"]\n  C[\"Cosine Similarity\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(\"Sentence A\") ==&gt; C\n  B(\"Sentence A\") ==&gt; C\n  C[\"BERT\"] ==&gt; D\n  D[\"Classifier\"] ==&gt; E  \n  E[\"0...1\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to use both of these methods in tandem. We can quickly retrieve the top 100 or so records using the bi-encoder, then re-rank the retrieved records using the bi-encoder. This way we limit the number of paired records we have to run through it.\nTo do this in Python I create a RetrieveReranker class. The class is initialized with a bi-encoder and cross-encoder model, and a corpus of text to serve as the searchable data base. Most of the important work is handled by the query function, which takes an input query string, creates an embedding, then retrieves the 100 most similar documents based on cosine similarity. These 100 records are then passed to the bi-encoder which re-ranks them and returns the most similar ones.\nI should note, this is a pretty limited first attempt at “off-the-shelf” pre-trained models. I’m not doing any pre-training, nor am I doing any fine-tuning here. It’s quite clear that both would strongly improve performance, but this is too simple of an example to warrant the effort.\n\n\nCode\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport pickle\n\n\nclass RetrieveReranker:\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        corpus,\n        bi_encoder_model,\n        cross_encoder_model,\n        save_corpus=False,\n        corpus_path=None,\n    ):\n        self.bi_encoder_model = bi_encoder_model\n        self.cross_encoder_model = cross_encoder_model\n        self.save_corpus = save_corpus\n        self.corpus_path = corpus_path\n\n        self.corpus = corpus  # raw text\n        self.corpus_embed = self._embed_corpus()  # embedded text\n\n    def _embed_corpus(self):\n        \"Embed and save a corpus of searchable text, or load corpus if present\"\n        embedding = None\n\n        try:\n            if os.path.exists(self.corpus_path):\n                embedding = self._load_corpus()\n            else:\n                embedding = self.bi_encoder_model.encode(self.corpus)\n\n                if self.save_corpus:\n                    self._save_corpus(embedding)\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error processing corpus: {e}\")\n\n        return embedding\n\n    def _save_corpus(self, embedding):\n        with open(self.corpus_path, \"wb\") as fOut:\n            pickle.dump(embedding, fOut)\n\n    def _load_corpus(self):\n        with open(self.corpus_path, \"rb\") as fIn:\n            return pickle.load(fIn)\n\n    def query(self, query_string, number_ranks=100, number_results=1):\n        \"\"\"Find the top N results matching the input string and returning the\n        matched string and the index.\"\"\"\n\n        ce_list = []\n\n        # embed query in bi-enocder, then get cosine similarities w/ corpus\n        query_embed = self.bi_encoder_model.encode(query_string)\n        sims = self.bi_encoder_model.similarity(query_embed, self.corpus_embed)\n        idx = np.array(torch.topk(sims, number_ranks).indices)[0]\n\n        # create a list of paired strings\n        for i in idx:\n            ce_list.append([query_string, self.corpus[i]])\n\n        # run cross-encoder, get top `number_results`\n        # convert to probabilities using invlogit\n        scores = self.cross_encoder_model.predict(ce_list)\n        probs = torch.sigmoid(torch.tensor(scores))\n        top_idx = np.argsort(scores)[-number_results:][::-1]\n            \n        # Retrieve the results based on top indices\n        res_idx = [int(idx[i]) for i in top_idx] \n        res_prb = torch.tensor([probs[i] for i in top_idx])\n        res_str = [ce_list[i][1] for i in top_idx] \n\n        return res_idx, res_prb, res_str"

Specifically we want to use a combination of a bi-encoder and cross-encoder to retrieve data based on an initial input query. The trade-off we have to deal with is that cross-enocder models are very slow, while bi-encoder models have performance that often falls short for retreval purposes.\nThe bi-encoder model (the “retrieve” part) creates seperate embeddings of the input query and corpus text and looks for the closest match based on the vector space. This is often done by finding the nearest cosine similarity. The retreval step is typically quite fast, with the trade-off that some information is lost because the query and search corpus are embedded seperately.\nOn the flip side, a cross encoder embeds the search query and corpus together. The major advantage of this, is that the cross-encoder uses cross-attention to create the similarity score, which pools information about the both inputs directly. However, the major trade off is that this requires the search query to be embedded with every query-corpus pair. In a very large dataset, this might create millions of pairs and is can be potentially very slow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(\"Sentence A\") ==&gt; BA ==&gt; SA ==&gt; C\n  B(\"Sentence B\") ==&gt; BB ==&gt; SB ==&gt; C\n  BA[\"BERT\"]\n  BB[\"BERT\"]\n  SA[\"Sentence Embedding\"]\n  SB[\"Sentence Embedding\"]\n  C[\"Cosine Similarity\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(\"Sentence A\") ==&gt; C\n  B(\"Sentence A\") ==&gt; C\n  C[\"BERT\"] ==&gt; D\n  D[\"Classifier\"] ==&gt; E  \n  E[\"0...1\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to use both of these methods in tandem. We can quickly retrieve the top 100 or so records using the bi-encoder, then re-rank the retrieved records using the bi-encoder. This way we limit the number of paired records we have to run through it.\nTo do this in Python I create a RetrieveReranker class. The class is initialized with a bi-encoder and cross-encoder model, and a corpus of text to serve as the searchable data base. Most of the important work is handled by the query function, which takes an input query string, creates an embedding, then retrieves the 100 most similar documents based on cosine similarity. These 100 records are then passed to the bi-encoder which re-ranks them and returns the most similar ones.\nI should note, this is a pretty limited first attempt at “off-the-shelf” pre-trained models. I’m not doing any pre-training, nor am I doing any fine-tuning here. It’s quite clear that both would strongly improve performance, but this is too simple of an example to warrant the effort.\n\n\nCode\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport pickle\n\n\nclass RetrieveReranker:\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        corpus,\n        bi_encoder_model,\n        cross_encoder_model,\n        save_corpus=False,\n        corpus_path=None,\n    ):\n        self.bi_encoder_model = bi_encoder_model\n        self.cross_encoder_model = cross_encoder_model\n        self.save_corpus = save_corpus\n        self.corpus_path = corpus_path\n\n        self.corpus = corpus  # raw text\n        self.corpus_embed = self._embed_corpus()  # embedded text\n\n    def _embed_corpus(self):\n        \"Embed and save a corpus of searchable text, or load corpus if present\"\n        embedding = None\n\n        try:\n            if os.path.exists(self.corpus_path):\n                embedding = self._load_corpus()\n            else:\n                embedding = self.bi_encoder_model.encode(self.corpus)\n\n                if self.save_corpus:\n                    self._save_corpus(embedding)\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error processing corpus: {e}\")\n\n        return embedding\n\n    def _save_corpus(self, embedding):\n        with open(self.corpus_path, \"wb\") as fOut:\n            pickle.dump(embedding, fOut)\n\n    def _load_corpus(self):\n        with open(self.corpus_path, \"rb\") as fIn:\n            return pickle.load(fIn)\n\n    def query(self, query_string, number_ranks=100, number_results=1):\n        \"\"\"Find the top N results matching the input string and returning the\n        matched string and the index.\"\"\"\n\n        ce_list = []\n\n        # embed query in bi-enocder, then get cosine similarities w/ corpus\n        query_embed = self.bi_encoder_model.encode(query_string)\n        sims = self.bi_encoder_model.similarity(query_embed, self.corpus_embed)\n        idx = np.array(torch.topk(sims, number_ranks).indices)[0]\n\n        # create a list of paired strings\n        for i in idx:\n            ce_list.append([query_string, self.corpus[i]])\n\n        # run cross-encoder, get top `number_results`\n        # convert to probabilities using invlogit\n        scores = self.cross_encoder_model.predict(ce_list)\n        probs = torch.sigmoid(torch.tensor(scores))\n        top_idx = np.argsort(scores)[-number_results:][::-1]\n            \n        # Retrieve the results based on top indices\n        res_idx = [int(idx[i]) for i in top_idx] \n        res_prb = torch.tensor([probs[i] for i in top_idx])\n        res_str = [ce_list[i][1] for i in top_idx] \n\n        return res_idx, res_prb, res_str"

    "text": "Creating A Records Retrieval Model\nNow that we have our class defined, we can import it below and utilize it. In order for it to work we need to pass in both a bi-encoder and a cross-encoder model. Recall, the bi-encoder will do the first pass to get the \\(N\\) most similar records, then pass these to the cross-encoder. Hence, the “retrieve and rerank” method. Below, we use ModernBERT in tandem with a SentenceTransformers model to do the embedding and first pass as the bi-encoder, and a MS Macro model as the cross encoder.\nNow, ideally we would fine-tune the cross-encoder model so that input queries would more closely match the medical narratives. This would have the added benefit of improvement performance for asymmeterical queries (e.g. providing a short query to retrieve a much longer text). But right now we can rely on out-of-the box performance as a demonstration.\nOur corpus is relatively small. We take a sample of 50,000 records from the 2022 NEISS dataset and use some local functions to clean up the NEISS text entries a bit before we pass them into the model. From these narratives we pass them through a SentenceTransformer model using ModernBert to embed them as a 50000x768 dimension array. Essentially this a fancy method of data compression, where we extract and store semantic meaning from the narratives as a vector of numeric values.\n\n\nCode\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nfrom sentence_transformers.cross_encoder import CrossEncoder\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\n\nfrom src.search_funcs import RetrieveReranker\n\n# local vars\nBI_ENCODER_MODEL = \"answerdotai/ModernBERT-base\"\nCROSS_ENCODER_MODEL = \"cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2\"\nCORPUS = \"C:/Users/gioc4/Documents/blog/data/falls/neis.csv\"\nCORPUS_SIZE = 50000\n\n# we want the observations to be agnostic to patient age, so we remove those\n# define remappings of abbreviations\n# and strings to remove from narratives\n\nremap = {\n    \"FX\": \"FRACTURE\",\n    \"INJ\": \"INJURY\",\n    \"LAC\": \"LACERATION\",\n    \"LOC\": \"LOSS OF CONCIOUSNESS\",\n    \"CONT\": \"CONTUSION\",\n    \"CHI\" : \"CLOSED HEAD INJURY\",\n    \"ETOH\": \"ALCOHOL\",\n    \"SDH\": \"SUBDURAL HEMATOMA\",\n    \"AFIB\": \"ATRIAL FIBRILLATION\",\n    \"NH\": \"NURSING HOME\",\n    \"LTCF\": \"LONG TERM CARE FACILITY\",\n    \"C/O\": \"COMPLAINS OF\",\n    \"H/O\": \"HISTORY OF\",\n    \"S/P\": \"STATUS POST\",\n    \"DX:\": \"DIAGNOSIS\",\n    \"YOM\": \"YEAR OLD MALE\",\n    \"YOF\": \"YEAR OLD FEMALE\",\n    \"MOM\": \"MONTH OLD MALE\",\n    \"MOF\": \"MONTH OLD FEMALE\",\n    \"PT\": \"PATIENT\",\n    \"LT\": \"LEFT\",\n    \"RT\": \"RIGHT\",\n    \"&\" : \" AND \"\n}\n\ndef process_text(txt):\n\n    # remap leading age and sex info\n    txt = re.sub(r\"(\\d+)(YOM|YOF|MOM|MOF)\", lambda m: f\"{m.group(1)} {remap[m.group(2)]}\", txt)\n\n    words = txt.split()\n    new_words = [remap.get(word, word) for word in words]\n    txt = \" \".join(new_words)\n\n    return re.sub(r\"^\\s+\", \"\", txt)\n\n\nNow that we’re ready, we can encode the corpus using the pre-defined models by passing it all into our RetrieveReranker class. Passing the corpus_path argument allows us to save the embeddings as a pickle file and reload it when it exists so we don’t have to go through the very time consuming process of re-embedding the corpus each time we do this. Without using a GPU embedding 50,000 narratives takes around 30-40 minutes.\n\n# strings to encode as searchable\n# load data\nneis_data = pd.read_csv(CORPUS).head(CORPUS_SIZE)\nnarrative_strings = neis_data['Narrative_1'].apply(process_text).tolist()\n\n# define models and ranker\nbiencoder = SentenceTransformer(BI_ENCODER_MODEL)\ncrossencoder = CrossEncoder(CROSS_ENCODER_MODEL)\n\n# set up a Retriveal-Ranker class\nranker = RetrieveReranker(\n    corpus=narrative_strings,\n    bi_encoder_model=biencoder,\n    cross_encoder_model=crossencoder,\n    save_corpus=True,\n    corpus_path=\"C:/Users/gioc4/Documents/blog/data/corpus_large.pkl\"\n)\n\n\nRetreiving similar records\nAfter that has processed we’re ready to query our corpus with an example text string. Let’s imagine we had a case involving an elderly fall at an elderly care facility (ECF) and we wanted to find 5 similar cases based on information provided in the narrative:\n\n“100 YOM RESIDENT AT ECF FELL BACKWARDS ON THE FLOOR. DX: CERVICAL STRAIN, LUMBAR STRAIN”\n\nWe directly pass this query into our fitted RetrieveReranker and specify the number of results we want. We get indices and matching strings as output.\n\nquery = \"100 YOM RESIDENT AT ECF FELL BACKWARDS ON THE FLOOR. DX: CERVICAL STRAIN, LUMBAR STRAIN\"\n\nidx, proba, output = ranker.query(process_text(query), number_results=5)\n\nHere are the matching queries:\n\noutput\n\n['93 YEAR OLD FEMALE RESIDENT AT ECF LOST BALANCE AND FELL BACKWARDS ONTO THE FLOOR. DIAGNOSIS C-5 FRACTURE.',\n '87 YEAR OLD FEMALE RESIDENT AT ECF LOST BALANCE AND FELL BACKWARDS ON THE FLOOR. DIAGNOSIS SACRAL FRACTURE.',\n '84 YEAR OLD MALE RESIDENT AT ECF FELL ON THE FLOOR.

DX: ...\nV\n95\n17.2223\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 25 columns\n\n\n\n\n\nAsymmetrical queries\nGiven we have done zero fine tuning on either the embedding model or the cross encoder, the results are are pretty good. However, a notable weakness of this current approach is that the model is not robust for asymmetrical queries - that is, queries which are much shorter than the optimal one in the corpus. For example, let’s say we just wanted to find a case where an elderly person fell in a bathtub. Here I just type in a manual example:\n\nshort_query = \"80YOM SLIPPED AND FELL IN BATHTUB\"\n\n_, _, output = ranker.query(process_text(short_query ), number_results=5)\n\noutput\n\n['16 YEAR OLD MALE SLIPPED AND FELL GETTING OUT OF BATHTUB. DX CONCUSSION',\n '30 YEAR OLD MALE FELL IN BATHTUB DX; BACK CONTUSION',\n '62 YEAR OLD MALE SLIPPED AND FELL IN THE SHOWER. DX:CERVICAL STRAIN.',\n '61 YEAR OLD MALE SLIPPED AND FELL GETTING OUT OF SHOWER DX; R ANKLE FRACTURE',\n '71 YEAR OLD MALE FELL IN SHOWER DX NECK PAIN']\n\n\nThe results here are ok (they give us cases involving slip and falls in a bathtub) but we’ll note they are similarly short to the input query. For example, here is another narrative involving an elderly fall in the bathtub, but it is ranked much lower because its length and structure are asymmetrical to the input:\n\n“75YOM PT HAULING FIREWOOD 3 WKS AGO; DEVELOPED BACK PAIN. 2 NIGHTS AGO SLIPPED & FELL IN BATHTUB, COULDLN’T GET UP UNTIL MORNING WITH NEIGHBOR’S HELP DX: LOW BACK PAIN, SHINGLES, ELEVATED LIVER FUNCTION TESTS #”\n\nThis is because the retreveal model matches close to queries with similar lengths. In the case of a true querying model, we need to map questions to positive and negative inputs. Fine-tuning the cross-encoder could help improve this, although it is a time-consuming process. What I wanted to demonstrate here is not a “true” RAG search model, but more of a semantic search and retreval model. In the latter approach the model expects to see a more context-rich example to use for document retreval."

    "text": "Spatial Merging using Voronoi Polygons\n\nVoronoi Polygons\nVoronoi polygons(or tessellations) are useful for a number of purposes. Given a set of points \\(j_n\\) we define a set of \\(n\\) regions where all spaces within each region has a single nearest neighbor of the initial point \\(i\\). Practically speaking, this just means we sub-divide a study area into smaller areas corresponding to the proximity to a point. This has many useful properties, such as determining nearest-neighbor distances from points to points. Let’s see how we can do this in R.\nTo start, we’ll first use a helper function to convert the Voronoi tessellation to an sf object that is suitable for merging. We’ll then merge the camera data to the polygon we just created (using st_intersection) and pull a few of the variables we’ll want for this example.\n\n\nCode\n# Helper function to simplify tessellation\n# borrowed from: \n# https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/362134\nst_voronoi_point &lt;- function(points){\n  ## points must be POINT geometry\n  # check for point geometry and execute if true\n  if(!all(st_geometry_type(points) == \"POINT\")){\n    stop(\"Input not  POINT geometries\")\n  }\n  g = st_combine(st_geometry(points)) # make multipoint\n  v = st_voronoi(g)\n  v = st_collection_extract(v)\n  return(v[unlist(st_intersects(points, v))])\n}\n\n\n# create Voronoi tessellation over cameras\ncamera_poly &lt;- st_voronoi_point(camera) %&gt;%\n  st_intersection(austin) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  mutate(camera_id = camera$camera_id,\n         camera_X = camera$camera_X,\n         camera_Y = camera$camera_Y)\n\n\nNow we can plot the result. Below we see we now have a defined set of regions corresponding to the areas nearest to each camera. Therefore, any crashes that occur in one of the Voronoi polygons is also its nearest camera. This saves us the step of determining which point is its nearest neighbor.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = camera_poly, fill = \"#88CCEE\", alpha = .3) +\n  geom_sf(data = camera, color = '#004488', shape = 3, size = 2, stroke = 1.5) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\nAll spaces within each Voronoi polygon are a nearest neighbor to a camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Merging\nAfter we’ve created the Voronoi regions, all we need to do is merge each point to the region it falls within (which implies the camera there is its nearest neighbor) and then compute the euclidean distance from the crash to the camera. The code below uses a for-loop to get the pairwise distances after spatial joining and then limits the output to only crashes that are within 300 feet of the nearest camera.\n\n\nCode\n# JOIN AND MERGE\n# ----------------------- #\n\n# compute euclidean distance\nedist &lt;- function(a,b){\n  sqrt(sum((a - b) ^ 2))\n}\n\n# get x-y coords for crashes and cameras\n# convert to matrix\ncamera_crash &lt;-  st_join(crash_sf,camera_poly) %&gt;%\n  tibble() %&gt;%\n  select(camera_id, \n         crash_id, \n         camera_X, \n         camera_Y, \n         crash_X, \n         crash_Y)\n\ndmat &lt;- matrix(c(camera_crash$camera_X, \n                 camera_crash$camera_Y, \n                 camera_crash$crash_X, \n                 camera_crash$crash_Y),\n               ncol = 4)\n\n# compute pairwise distances\ndlist &lt;- list()\nfor(i in 1:nrow(dmat)){\n  dlist[[i]] &lt;- edist(c(dmat[i,1], dmat[i,2]), c(dmat[i,3], dmat[i,4]))\n}\n\ncamera_crash$dist &lt;- unlist(dlist)\n\n# get ids of within 300 meters\ndist_ids &lt;- camera_crash$dist &lt;= 300\n\n\nNow we can plot the results. As we see below we now only have crashes that are within 300 feet or less of the nearest camera. One advantage of this approach is that we can make any adjustments to the spatial region we’re interested in by just adjusting the filter above - or we can use the full range of distances in our analysis and look at decay effects (for example, the effect of CCTV cameras on crime clearance).\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = austin, fill = \"#88CCEE\", alpha = .3) +\n  geom_sf(data = crash_sf[dist_ids,], color = '#BB5566', size = .6, alpha = .7) +\n  geom_sf(data = camera, color = '#004488', shape = 3, size = 2, stroke = 1.5) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\nCar crashes within 300 meters of a traffic camera.\n\n\n\n\nWith this done, we can do any kind of further investigation. For example, which camera observed the greatest number of crashes? Here, the top-ranked camera is at a 4-way intersection leading to the highway. Also, due to its proximity to the highway, it’s very likely that our distance size (300 meters, or about 900 feet) is picking up accidents that are occurring on the highway below. Of course, this is just a demonstration of method of spatial merging, not an investigation into traffic accidents in Austin!\n\n\nCode\ncamera_crash %&gt;%\n  filter(crash_id %in% crash_sf[dist_ids,]$crash_id) %&gt;%\n  count(camera_id) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:5)\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  camera_id     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 919          72\n2 674          59\n3 948          46\n4 155          44\n5 962          35"

    "text": "Summary\nThis little mini-blog highlighted some approaches that can be taken to perform a relatively common spatial procedure. Using Voronoi polygons we looked at how we can use them to easily calculate nearest-neighbor distances. These types of spatial approaches aren’t necessarily the sexiest topics, but I find they often help considerably with modelling pipelines down the road. Sometimes have a good foundation can help with further analysis later.\n\nAn Aside: An even (easier) method?\nOf course, another method is to simply use the a convenient function embedded in the sf library aptly named st_nearest_feature(). This takes two sf objects and returns the indexes of \\(y\\) that are nearest to \\(x\\). While the solution here is equivalent to the one above, it might not necessarily be available in your given software package. Also, while I have no testing to support this, I expect that this would likely be slow in case of many pairwise distances. The presence of the polygons helps avoid the unnecessary computation of distances between points that are not nearest neighbors.\n\n# get index of cameras nearest to each point\nidx &lt;- st_nearest_feature(crash_sf, camera)\nid_dist &lt;- st_distance(camera[idx,], crash_sf, by_element = TRUE)\n\nid_dist[1:5]\n\nUnits: [m]\n         1          2          3          4          5 \n  49.88593 1202.17589  784.61324 1412.67832  282.73844"

Some of the most common examples come from network intrusion detection, mechanical processes, and other types of high-volume streaming data.\nOf course, there are just as many proposed ways of identifying outliers from the simple (basic Z-scores) to the complex (convolutional neural networks). There are also some approaches that rely on more conventional tabular approaches. Rob Hyndman proposed a few approaches here and here showing how many high-volume time series can be compressed into a tabular dataset. The general idea is that you can decompose many time series into tabular observations by creating a large variety of features describing each series.\n\n\nThe data we’ll use is on hourly power usage for a large power company (American Electric Power). From this dataset we can perform some basic aggregation (to ensure that all timestamped values are on the same day-hour), then separate each set of 24 hours into their individual days. The goal here is to make it easier to look at hours within each day. The code below does a bit of this processing. Of course, working with dates is still always a pain, despite the improvements in R libraries.\n\n\nCode\n# Read data, convert to zoo\nelec &lt;- read_csv(\"AEP_hourly.csv\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Datetime) %&gt;%\n  summarise(AEP_MW = sum(AEP_MW)) %&gt;%\n  filter(year(Datetime) %in% 2017)\n\nelec_ts &lt;- zoo(x = elec$AEP_MW, order.by = elec$Datetime, frequency = 24)\n\n# Split the hourly time series into daily time series\ndaily_ts_list &lt;- split(elec_ts, as.Date(index(elec_ts)))\n\n# Extract the first 24 observations of each daily time series\n# dropping days with missing values\ndaily_24_ts_list &lt;- lapply(daily_ts_list, function(x) {\n  if (length(x) &gt;= 24) {\n    return(x[1:24])\n  } else {\n    return(NA)\n  }\n})\n\n# Convert from list to dataframe\ndaily_24_ts_list &lt;- purrr::discard(daily_24_ts_list, ~any(is.na(.)))\n\n\nAfter converting the list of values to a data frame, we can proceed with the featurization.

The PCA anomaly detector that was detailed in an earlier post is an easy plug in here and is a natural fit for the problem. We have a lot of highly correlated measures that likely share a large amount of variance across a few dimensions. We can then weight the lower-variance dimensions higher to identify anomalous series.

It would probably be worthwhile testing this approach against something like STL decomposition."

    "section": "Do you get less food online?",
    "text": "Do you get less food online?\nLet’s answer this question. To start, we can look at the general distribution of weights. Below we see that the median weight of an order is just under 800 grams, or about 1.7 pounds. The largest order he got was a whopping 2.3 pounds, and the smallest was 1.1 pounds.\n\n\nCode\nquantile(food_weight_data$weight)\n\n\n       0%       25%       50%       75%      100% \n 510.2910  715.8249  793.7860  907.1840 1048.9315 \n\n\nIf we plot out a little density plot we can see the distribution of weights is (approximately) normal, with online orders appearing to be a bit lighter than in-person ones. Without adjusting for anything else, the median weight of online orders is about 709 grams, and in-person orders are 907. However, just based on this visual we can’t be certain it isn’t due to other factors (for example, maybe he ordered more heavy items only online).\n\nBox PlotDensity PlotHistogram\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(food_weight_data) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(x = weight, y = Order, fill = Order), alpha = .8) +\n  labs(x = \"Weight (grams)\", y = \"Order Type\", title = \"Box Plot, Chipotle Order Weights (n=30)\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#4477AA', '#EE6677')) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = 'none',\n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        legend.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, in-person orders appear to be larger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(food_weight_data) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = weight, fill = Order), color = 'white', linewidth = 1, alpha = .8) +\n  labs(x = \"Weight (grams)\", y = \"Probability Density\", title = \"Density Plot, Chipotle Order Weights (n=30)\", subtitle = \"Y axis is smoothed PDF\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#4477AA', '#EE6677')) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = c(.1,.9),\n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        legend.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, in-person orders appear to be larger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(food_weight_data) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = weight, fill = Order), color = 'white', linewidth = 1, alpha = .8, bins = 10) +\n  labs(x = \"Weight (grams)\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Histogram, Chipotle Order Weights (n=30)\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#4477AA', '#EE6677')) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = c(.1,.9),\n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        legend.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, in-person orders appear to be larger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nTo determine whether online orders weigh less than in-person orders, we can just apply some simple statistics. Here, I fit a linear regression with each blocking factor. In this way we “control” for variables we know affect order weight (e.g. bowls weigh more than burritos, or store 3 gives you more food than store 1). In the end all we care about is the coefficient for the effect of ordering online relative to ordering in-person.\n\n\nCode\n# in-person ordering yields about 160g more food, or about more 20% on average\nfit1 &lt;- lm(weight ~ Order + Meat + Store + food, data = food_weight_data)\n\nbroom::tidy(fit1) %&gt;%\n  kable(digits = 2, caption = \"Linear regression on order weight\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(\"striped\") %&gt;%\n  row_spec(2, bold = T, hline_after = T)\n\n\n\nLinear regression on order weight\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n843.22\n36.42\n23.15\n0.00\n\n\nOrderPerson\n160.62\n30.22\n5.31\n0.00\n\n\nMeatChicken\n-29.47\n32.48\n-0.91\n0.37\n\n\nStoreStore 2\n-62.26\n36.74\n-1.69\n0.10\n\n\nStoreStore 3\n-93.44\n36.74\n-2.54\n0.02\n\n\nfoodBurrito\n-82.38\n30.22\n-2.73\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, after controlling for the other variables we see that the effect of ordering in-person relative to online is 160 grams more food (or about 5.6 ounces). Based on the orders he submitted that roughly equates to 20% more food from ordering in-person rather than online!\nSo, yes, in this case it does appear that ordering online resulted in smaller orders relative to in-person.\n\n\nCaveats\nAll of this analysis assumes that the online orders were roughly equivalent to the in-person one (e.g. ordering the same ingredients online as in-person). This would not be valid if he tended to order more additional items when in the store rather then online. However, from watching the video and looking at the listed cost of all items ($11.00) it appears that the orders are comparable.\nI would also caution against extrapolation. The data here comes for 30 orders from a single city in the US. It is a limited set of data with a limited number of observations. So, as always with science, some degree of skepticism is always warranted.\n\n\nFull Model\n\n\nCode\nsummary(lm(weight ~ Order + Meat + Store + food, data = food_weight_data))\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = weight ~ Order + Meat + Store + food, data = food_weight_data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-147.79  -43.47   -8.17   52.23  129.06 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

    "text": "How Good Are They?\nOne nagging question I’ve always had is whether their performance on these segments were any better than if they just randomly guessed each time. Blind taste-testing is actually very hard, and distinguishing between 6 different pieces of mass-produced fried meat is probably even harder. Indeed, their performance on a lot of these segments is actually not great. To answer this, I gathered data from all the blind fast food taste tests that I could find, and collected it into a Google Sheet. Most of the games have 6 options, but a few have 5. For simplicity I will focus on the 26 segments where there were six choices available.\n\nChecking Out the Data\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nset.seed(7132322)\n\n# Load Data\n# ---------------\n\ngsheet &lt;-\n  \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P_LIZnnnaoCZHwmmrBM3O26sPAGCekVj_3qmWyyxTpc/edit?usp=sharing\"\n\ntaste_test &lt;- read_sheet(ss = gsheet) %&gt;%\n  filter(options == 6)\n\n\nThe sheet here has columns corresponding to each game played food, with Rhett and Link’s number of correct guesses stored in their own columns.\n\n\nCode\nhead(taste_test)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  food          options rhett  link\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 fries               6     4     3\n2 nuggets             6     6     3\n3 fried chicken       6     0     2\n4 bbq pork            6     2     3\n5 donut               6     0     1\n6 taco                6     2     2\n\n\nFirst, let’s look at the distribution of correct guesses for Rhett and Link. We can generate just a simple bar chart here:\n\n\nCode\n# Plot R v L\n# ---------------\n\n# plot observed correct answers for R&L\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nbarplot(prop.table(table(taste_test$rhett)), \n        main = \"Rhett\", \n        sub = paste0(\"Avg. Correct: \",round(mean(taste_test$rhett),3)),\n        col = '#e6862c')\nbarplot(prop.table(table(taste_test$link)), \n        col = '#4ec726', \n        sub = paste0(\"Avg. Correct: \",round(mean(taste_test$link),3)),\n        main = \"Link\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrangely enough, based on the 26 games that I collected, Rhett and Link have the exact same number of correct guesses. We can see, however, that their distributions are quite different (Rhett has a single game with all 6 right, and several with 4 correct, but also many more games with none correct). As expected, across all games we see their average is about 1.9 correct answers. Now, recall, our question here is “is Rhett and Link’s performance better than chance alone?”\n\n\nRandom Guessing With Replacement\nSo if we want to compare their performance to “chance” - that is, totally random guessing - we need a probability distribution. Here, the binomial is logical starting point. Let’s start with the simplest assumption of randomly guessing one of the six options with replacement (meaning you can guess the same option twice). While this doesn’t necessarily seem like an ideal strategy, Rhett and Link often do guess the same location two or three times.\nWe can use the probability density function for the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of guessing between 0 and 6 items correctly, where each trial is assumed to be independent. Below, we see that there is about a 67% probability of guessing at least one of the items correctly, and a 40% chance of getting exactly one correct. Getting more than 4 correct is very rare. If we look at the observed results above, we see this mostly matches up. Both Rhett and Link rarely get more that 3 correct.\n\n\nCode\n# totally random (w replacement)\nround(dbinom(0:6, 6, 1/6), 3)\n\n\n[1] 0.335 0.402 0.201 0.054 0.008 0.001 0.000\n\n\n\n\nRandom Guessing Without Replacement\nNow, another strategy might be randomly guess, but not repeat any previous guesses. Instead of the guesses being independent, they are now dependent on prior guesses. That means we need to use a different method to calculate this. The hypergeometric distribution is commonly used to calculate this (e.g. dhyper()). This also falls within the realm of permutation-based math ala derangements. However, I am a simple man with a good computer and a less-good maths background, so I will simply simulate it.\n\n\nCode\n# totally random (w/o replacement)\n# simulate\nn = 1e5\n\nalist &lt;- vector(mode = \"list\", length = n)\nfor(j in 1:n){\n  truth &lt;- sample(1:6, 6)\n  guess &lt;- sample(1:6, 6)\n  \n  alist[j] &lt;- sum(guess == truth)\n  \n}\n\nres &lt;- sapply(alist, sum)\nprop.table(table(res))\n\n\nres\n      0       1       2       3       4       6 \n0.37032 0.36459 0.18739 0.05538 0.02081 0.00151 \n\n\nHere we see that if we limit our guesses to only options not previously guessed, there is a roughly equal probability of getting between 0 and 1 answers correct, and about a 28% chance of getting more than 1 correct. Note, under this strategy it is not possible to get 5 answers correct (because if you incorrectly order at least one item, by definition at least one other item is also incorrectly ordered)"

    "text": "Difference-in-Differences\nWhat is difference-in-differences (DiD)? Well, to keep it brutally short, I’ll rely on the definition provided by some leading folks in DiD(Baker et al. 2025):\n\nA basic DiD design requires two time periods, one before and one after some treatment begins, and two groups, one that receives a treatment and one that does not. The DiD estimate equals the change in outcomes for the treated group minus the change in outcomes for the untreated group: the difference of two differences.\n\nEmphasis mine. Let’s review the example from the Cape Town report briefly. There are two period, two groups, and 4 values for number of crimes. We can construct this in R quite easily. First, I’ll create a dataframe to hold the necessary information. You’ll note that I add variables for time period (where 0 is pre-treatment and 1 is post-treatment), and a variable for treatment group (either 0 for control and 1 for treatment).\n\noutcome_table &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = c(\"control\", \"control\", \"treat\", \"treat\"),\n  time = c(0, 1, 0, 1),\n  treat = c(0,0,1,1),\n  count = c(447, 435, 729, 617)\n)\n\nAnd now using these data we can plot the slopes of the two periods for the two groups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing the setup for this type of DiD model is actually very simple. A two-group, two-period model is often canonically known as a 2x2 DiD model. When I used to teach, I would often explain that most DiD models (and, by extension, most of statistics) is essentially fancy averaging. Therefore, computing the DiD estimand from a 2x2 model requires only a little simple math, which we can supplement with some functionality in R.\nIf we want to directly compute this in R, we can just use the lm function to do it all for us. lm in R sets up a linear regression model, where we provide an indicator for time (pre, post), and an indicator for treatment group (control, treat). The value that we are interested in is the number of crimes in the treatment group, in the post-treatment period, after subtracting out the prior differences in groups. The DiD estimand is simply the interaction between the treatment indicator and the time period:\n\n\nCode\nlm(count ~ time * treat, data = outcome_table)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = count ~ time * treat, data = outcome_table)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)         time        treat   time:treat  \n        447          -12          282         -100  \n\n\nWe see a few things here:\n\nThe (Intercept) which is the number of crimes when time=0, treat=0 and time:treat=0. So this is the number of reported crimes in the control group in the pre-treatment period, which is \\(447\\).\ntime which is the change in crime for the control group from time=0 to time=1. Here this is \\(-12 = 435-447\\)).\ntreat is the difference in crimes between the treated and control group when time=0. Here we see this is simply \\(282 = 729-447\\)\nAnd finally the DiD estimand, which is the number of crimes in the treatment group in the post-treatment period, subtracting out the prior differences in the pre-treatment period. Here we see it is \\(-100\\) which means we estimate that there were 100 fewer crimes in the treatment area relative to the control area.\n\nA caveat here: typically we the treatment and control groups are averages of multiple units (e.g. neighborhoods or police beats). Since we only have access to the aggregated table we can’t compute variances or test-statistics because the model is fully saturated (4 parameters for 4 data points)."

I still see a ton of work using DiD designs (whether the authors are aware of it or not). Sometimes I find looking at the most basic version of a model design is often helpful before working on increasingly more complex ones. For example, models that account for staggered treatment implementation and treatment variation.\nThis barely scratches the surface, so if you are actually interested in this, I’d suggest a few difference resources:\n\nCausal Inference: The Mixtape\nMostly Harmless Econometrics\nDifference-in-Differences: A Practitioner’s Guide"

    "text": "The Question\nSo how do we go about answering this question? Well, I can break it down quite simply:\n\nStep 1\nFirst I will assume you have python installed, and it is on your PATH (see a StackExchange post here if you are not familiar). This is necessary so you can call python directly from the command line. When you’re installing python for the first time you typically can just click an option to add python to the PATH variables on Windows.\n\n\nStep 2\nNow we just need to write the file and save it somewhere:\n\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nYou can literally just open a text file, add the code above, and then save the text file with a .py extension. I just saved it as demo.py.\n\n\n\nHere is our lonely ‘Hello World’ file\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\nFinally, we just need to execute the python file. Book up command prompt (can click the little window icon and type cmd to get it to pop up). Just navigate to where ever the file is (or call the full file path directly) and append python in front of it.\n\n\n\nVoila! We’ve passed the first question!"

    "text": "So What?\nI know this is a bit of an “old man yells at cloud” kind of post, but I do have a deeper point here. Back when I was teaching stats as a professor many, many of my students did not know how file paths worked, how to navigate through directories, or even how to find a file that they downloaded off the class page! I don’t blame them at all - moreso I blame how most children and teens interact with computers - which is almost exclusively through apps and things like Chromebooks. They certainly make the user experience easy, but leave you with little understanding of how these tools actually work. For most people who don’t need to work in-depth with computers, it might be a huge issue. However, when we have data scientists who are flaunting 4-5 years of python experience and can’t execute a file using command prompt, it makes me a bit more concerned.\nPersonally, I think a lot of these “bootcamps” that promise to turn you into a fully-fledged data scientist in 12 weeks don’t really give you much more information than how to run off-the-shelf models in a notebook. Definitely good for a start, but woefully inadequate for real-world work. As a self-taught programmer I would highly encourage people interested in data-focused jobs to expand their horizons and broaden their skills.\nIncidentally, my friend Andy Wheeler has a book which is a really great into to python on his personal website here. If you are at all interested in dipping your toes into python (especially if you are a crime analyst) I would highly reccomend it."

    "text": "DuckDB and R\nThere are a lot of different ways to interface with SQL. In earlier projects I’ve used a SQLite database to manage a very large dataset and then query it from R. However, this approach requires you to create a .sqlite database and adds a bit of up-front work. Often times I might just have one or two very large tables where this approach is a bit overkill. For example, working with raw NIBRS data entails only a few important tables (victim, offender, offense) but each table is far too large to work with directly.\nDuckDB is a great option here because it has a ton of very useful functions that allow you to read directly from a .csv or other type of file (JSON, Parquet,etc…). In addition this can work directly in R using a client API. For an academic, we often only have simple tables like these to work with and so having an option that we can easily integrate into our workflow is really appealing.\n\nSetting it up\nAs an example, I have some crime data from Detroit that I used for a project a few years back. The size of this file is large (although not that large). However it is big enough that it might be reasonable to pull only a subset of the data into memory at a time. Here’s a perfect use-case for duckDB. Below, I start by loading the duckdb library and setting up the working directory of the file location dir as a string. This will make it a bit cleaner to read and pass in to our queries when we start working.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(duckdb)\nlibrary(sf)\n\nwd &lt;- \"../Documents/blog/data/\"\nfile_name &lt;- \"crime.csv\"\ndir &lt;- paste0(wd,file_name)\n\nWe then set up a connection object via dbConnect and use duckdb() as the connector. After we do that all we need to do is built a SQL string and pass it in. The script below reads all the columns (SELECT *) from the table listed in the directory crime.csv and pulls only the top 10 rows. And this builds the connection and executes the query:\n\ncon = dbConnect(duckdb())\ndbGetQuery(con, sprintf(\"SELECT * FROM read_csv('%s') LIMIT 10\", dir))\n\n         category       offense       crno       date           address\n1           FRAUD FRAUD (OTHER) 1501070062 2015-01-07     02600 E 8MILE\n2  STOLEN VEHICLE VEHICLE THEFT 1501310051 2015-01-31     15300 VAUGHAN\n3           FRAUD FRAUD (OTHER) 1503160171 2015-02-01     10000 GEORGIA\n4  STOLEN VEHICLE VEHICLE THEFT 1502020211 2015-02-02 14900 E JEFFERSON\n5           FRAUD FRAUD (OTHER) 1504090191 2015-02-02    20500 SAN JUAN\n6         ASSAULT  INTIMIDATION 1502090035 2015-02-09    14400 FREELAND\n7  STOLEN VEHICLE VEHICLE THEFT 1502240058 2015-02-23   15700 KENTFIELD\n8           FRAUD FRAUD (OTHER) 1502240128 2015-02-24   19300 PINEHURST\n9           FRAUD FRAUD (OTHER) 1502270221 2015-02-25      00100 SEWARD\n10          FRAUD FRAUD (OTHER) 1502270182 2015-02-25    19100 KEYSTONE\n        lon     lat     yr_mon crime_type\n1  -83.0759 42.4466 2015-01-01   property\n2  -83.2380 42.4021 2015-01-01   property\n3  -83.0042 42.3961 2015-02-01   property\n4  -82.9388 42.3746 2015-02-01   property\n5  -83.1480 42.4453 2015-02-01   property\n6  -83.1846 42.3945 2015-02-01   disorder\n7  -83.2407 42.4055 2015-02-01   property\n8  -83.1670 42.4333 2015-02-01   property\n9  -83.0786 42.3748 2015-02-01   property\n10 -83.0510 42.4341 2015-02-01   property\n\n\nVoila!

We can do any kind of reporting and aggregations. For example, if we wanted some basic information about crime at the year-month level we could do:\n\nqu = \n  \"SELECT\n      crime_type,\n      yr_mon,\n      COUNT(crime_type) AS N\n  FROM\n      read_csv('%s')\n  GROUP BY\n      crime_type,\n      yr_mon\n  ORDER BY\n      crime_type,\n      yr_mon\"\n\ntab &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, sprintf(qu, dir))\nhead(tab)\n\n  crime_type     yr_mon    N\n1   disorder 2015-01-01 1518\n2   disorder 2015-02-01 1447\n3   disorder 2015-03-01 1797\n4   disorder 2015-04-01 1884\n5   disorder 2015-05-01 2125\n6   disorder 2015-06-01 1839\n\n\nThis performs the group-by and counts out of memory and then moves the aggregated table right into R as a dataframe. And since the result is just a dataframe, we can pipe it directly into a ggplot visualization, like:\n\ndbGetQuery(con, sprintf(qu, dir)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = yr_mon, y = N, color = crime_type), linewidth = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~crime_type, scales = \"free\", ncol = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Year-Month\", y = \"Count\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('#004488', '#DDAA33', '#BB5566')) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = 'none')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, this applies to other functions like creating spatial objects. What if we wanted to plot only the violent crimes from the first month of 2015?\n\nqu =\n  \"SELECT *\n  FROM \n      read_csv('%s')\n  WHERE \n      crime_type = 'violent'\n  AND\n      datepart('year', yr_mon) = 2015\n  AND\n      datepart('month', yr_mon) = 1\n\"\n\nst_as_sf(dbGetQuery(con, sprintf(qu, dir)),\n         coords = c('lon', 'lat'),\n         crs = 4326) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(shape = 21, alpha = .2, fill = '#BB5566') +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is pretty cool too, because we have access to all the base functions available in duckDB. For example, there are a bunch of date handling functions that make these types of queries a lot easier than other base SQL languages. Here, the datepart function lets us split up date objects very easily within SQL."

    "text": "Creating the KNN anomaly detector\n\nDefining distance\nIn a way, the K-nearest neighbors anomaly detector is incredibly simple. To compute the anomalousness of a single point we measure its distance to its \\(k\\) nearest neighbors. We then use either the maximum or average distance among those \\(k\\) points as its anomaly score. However, there is some additional complexity here regarding the choice of \\(k\\) in an unsupervised setting - but we’ll get to that in a moment.\nOne issue is that computing all pairs of nearest neighbors has \\(O(N^2)\\) time complexity. However, we only need to know the number of nearest neighbors up to our value of \\(k\\). Therefore, we can avoid computing nearest unnecessary distances by applying more efficient algorithms - like k-d trees. In the case for \\(k\\) nearest neighbors the time complexity is \\(O(N * log(N)\\). The RANN package in R does this fairly efficiently. We’ll use the same data as in the previous post for this example.\n\n# scale input attributes\nX &lt;- df[, 2:7]\nX &lt;- scale(X)\n\n# compute NN distance between all points\n# set n neighbors\nk = 5\n\n# compute k nearest neighbor distances\n# using kd-trees\nd &lt;- RANN::nn2(X, k = k+1)\nd &lt;- d[[2]][,1:k+1]\n\nYou will notice that we set \\(k\\) to \\(k+1\\) to avoid calculating the nearest-neighbor distance to the each point itself (which is always zero). The nn2 package gives us the Euclidean nearest-neighbor distances for each point arranged from nearest to farthest. For example if we look at the top 3 rows of the distance matrix we see:\n\n\nCode\nd[1:3,]\n\n\n          [,1]      [,2]      [,3]      [,4]      [,5]\n[1,] 0.1457822 0.3123632 0.3311984 0.3641609 0.3726815\n[2,] 0.5261689 0.6887312 0.9636189 1.0087124 1.0097114\n[3,] 0.2874466 0.3044159 0.3723676 0.4139428 0.4251863\n\n\nWhich gives us the standardized (Z-score) distance to the \\(k\\) nearest neighbor of point \\(i\\). Now all we need to do is decide on how we will summarize this distance."

    "section": "Distance Measures",
    "text": "Distance Measures\nWe have a few options for distance measures. The most common, and simplest to understand arguably, is to compute a score based on the distance to each observations farthest \\(k\\) neighbor (so if \\(k=5\\) the score is the largest distance among those 5 neighbors). We can accomplish this by just getting the max value from each row.\n\nanom_max &lt;- apply(d, 1, max)\n\nWe also have another option. Rather than choosing the maximum of the 5 nearest neighbors, we can average over a larger number of neighbors. This has the advantage of removing some of the variance implicit in the choice of \\(k\\). For example, imagine the distance to the 6 nearest neighbors of one point are \\([1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 100]\\). If we chose \\(k=5\\) we would miss the obvious outlier that would have been found had we instead chosen \\(k=6\\). A good alternative to is set \\(k\\) much higher and get the average of all neighbors within that range. Here, we might set \\(k\\) to 20 and average over the distances.\n\nanom_mean &lt;- adKNN(d, k = 20, method = \"mean\")\n\nIn many cases there will be very strong overlap between the two metrics, but in my personal experience I find that in unsupervised cases it is usually better to err on the safe side and go with metrics that do not depend on a single decision (hence, the entire purpose of outlier ensembling!)\nLike before we can specify a cut-point to flag outliers. Here, it might be reasonable to set it to the highest 5% of anomaly scores. Unfortunately, there’s not necessarily a clear p-value available here like there was with the PCA anomaly detector. Ideally, if we have some prior information about the expected amount of contamination we could use that as our threshold instead. The plot below displays the 10 observations with the highest anomaly scores. The values flagged here look very similar to the ones that were identified by the PCA anomaly detector as well, which should give us some confidence.\n\n\nCode\nscored_data &lt;- data.frame(df,anom_mean)\n\nflag &lt;- scored_data$anom_mean &gt;= quantile(scored_data$anom_mean, .95)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = scored_data, aes(x = stay_len, y = diff), color = '#004488', size = 2, alpha = .25) +\n  geom_point(data = scored_data[flag,], aes(x = stay_len, y = diff), color = '#BB5566', size = 2.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Stay Length\", y = \"Avg.

    "section": "Working on the outside",
    "text": "Working on the outside\nMy hypothesis for the fake ticketing was that officers wanted to quickly pad their activity logs with fake stops. Because creating a stop log requires filling out a standardized form, I assumed that these officers would do it as quickly and as lazily as possible. I can imagine this looking like an officer at the end of their shift padding out activity with a bunch of zero-effort fake stops. Relying on this hunch, I figured I could detect unusual officer behavior by finding those whose distribution of stop times looked much different than the average officer. Humans are actually quite bad at generating “random” numbers. In order to pad out a shift, there would probably be a lot of stops with very short times.\n\nThe Data\nThe data for this comes from Connecticut’s Racial Profiling Prohibition Project data portal. These contain data on all traffic stops conducted by local and state police, which have information on the time, date, reason for the stop, and some basic demographic information on the driver. For this analysis I use the data from 2018, and focus on unique stops involving only officers from the Connecticut State Police.\nUnfortunately for me, the publicly available data doesn’t directly disclose the length of the stop. There is a variable InterventionDurationCode which only reports the length of the stop between 3 bins: (0-15, 16-30, 30+). For my purposes this is far too coarse of a measure to distinguish abnormal stop lengths. However, as an analog, I figured I could instead compute the time interval between stops. That is, the interval in time between when one stop begins and the next stop begins. This gives us an indirect way of measuring how long a stop took before the next stop was initiated:\n\\[interval= time_{stop2} - time_{stop_1}\\]\nSo if we had two stops, with one at 16:31:31 and one at 16:40:15, the interval would be about 8.7 minutes. As an example, this would look like:\n\n\n          ID       Troop Violation_Type       Date     Time Duration Interval\n1 1000001884 CSP Troop E  STC Violation 2018-01-07 16:31:31     &lt;NA&gt;       NA\n2 1000001884 CSP Troop E  Speed Related 2018-01-07 16:40:15 524 secs 8.733333"

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nTo start, it makes sense to first evaluate what “average” stop length intervals look like. One way of doing this is just a bunch of density plots for each officer. Here we’re looking at the top 100 officers by number of stops for 2018. The dark line here is the average for all 100 officers. We can see that the majority of stop intervals are between 10 and 20 minutes, with a long tail reaching out to our maximum of 1 hour. This makes sense, because most traffic stops are pretty perfunctory: warning drivers that a tail light is out, writing a ticket for speeding, etc…). However, a small number of traffic stops are more complex and might involve searches, DWI investigations, or require another officer to attend. Regardless, this plot below gives us some idea of the “average” stop time, as well as the individual behaviors of different officers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I think an easier way to visualize this is to transform the distribution above to the empirical cumulative density function (ECDF) for each officer. The ECDF is actually a very useful tool for this kind of question because it makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data. Simply put, and ECDF reports the proportion of observations at or below each given interval between \\([0,1]\\). All we do is report the cumulative value \\(1/n\\) for each of the \\(n\\) data points in a distribution. This is closely related to the quantile. Such that the ECDF at 0.5 is equivalent to the median.\nThe plot below shows the distribution of stop time intervals for all intervals between 0 and 60 minutes. The dark line is the average for all 100 officers, and the light colored lines are the individual officers’ ECDFs. Below we see that the median interval between stops is about 18 minutes. As we expect officer stop intervals are mostly randomly distributed above and below this. What we are actually interested in are officers whose ECDFs are unusually shorter compared to everyone else.\n\n\nCode\n# plot all ecdfs \necdf_plot(id = unique(daily_stop_interval$officer_id),\n          lwd = 3,\n          main = \"Empirical CDF, Time Interval Between Stops\",\n          xlab = \"Interval Time (minutes)\",\n          ylab = \"Percentiles\",\n          col = \"#004488\")\nfor(id in times$officer_id){\n  ecdf_plot(id, lines=TRUE,col = alpha(rgb(0, .267, .533), .1))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong stop intervals under 60 minutes the median stop interval was 14 minutes. Under 10% of stops had intervals less than 6.5 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervals\nTo get intervals we do the following:\n\n# compute bands on all ecdfs, for 100 points\ntime_min &lt;- min(daily_stop_interval$time_diff_min)\ntime_max &lt;- max(daily_stop_interval$time_diff_min)\nN_points &lt;- 125\n\nx_vals &lt;- seq(time_min, time_max, length.out = N_points)\n\n\n# Compute all ECDF values at each x for all officer IDs\necdf_values &lt;- sapply(times$officer_id, function(id) {\n  ecdf_func &lt;- ecdf(daily_stop_interval$time_diff_min[daily_stop_interval$officer_id == id])\n  ecdf_func(x_vals)  \n})\n\n\n# Compute 5th and 95th percentiles for the confidence bands\nlower_band &lt;- apply(ecdf_values, 1, function(row) quantile(row, 0.05))\nupper_band &lt;- apply(ecdf_values, 1, function(row) quantile(row, 0.95))\n\n\n\nOfficer “88185785”\nThis officer had the shortest average interval between stops at 14.2 minutes. In fact, more than half of their stops were at intervals of 10 minutes or less. This feels incredibly fast if you consider how long it takes to pull someone over. It seems implausible that this person was conducting almost non-stop traffic stops, taking driver information, issuing a warning (I assume?), and then getting another stop almost immediately afterwards.\n\n\nCode\nofficer_id = '88185785'\n\n# Add confidence bands (shaded region)\nplot.new()\nplot(c(0, 60), c(0,1), col = \"white\", \n     main = \"Empirical CDF, Time Interval Between Stops\",\n     xlab = \"Interval Time (minutes)\",\n     ylab = \"Percentiles\")\npolygon(c(x_vals, rev(x_vals)), c(lower_band, rev(upper_band)), \n        col = rgb(0, .267, .533, 0.3), border = NA)\nlines(x_vals, lower_band, col = \"#004488\", lwd = 2, lty = 3)\nlines(x_vals, upper_band, col = \"#004488\", lwd = 2, lty = 3)\necdf_plot(officer_id, col = '#BB5566', lwd=2, lines = T)"

    "text": "Chapter 8: Fitting Regression Models\nBefore working on anything too complicated, I think it is refreshing to start with a very simple regression problem. I know this already Chapter 8, but the first several chapters of the book are mostly a very basic intro into Bayesian statistics, data analysis, and some other more standard stuff. I’m choosing to skip ahead a bit. Chapter 8 starts with an introduction to a very simple bivariate regression using an interesting dataset from Douglas Hibbs’ fundementals-based election forecasting model (oddly appropriate, given when I am writing this):\n\nThe Hibbs “Bread and Peace” Model\nThe data below is part of Douglas Hibb’s “Bread and Peace” model of U.S. elections. The data below show the proportion of the 2-party vote share for the incumbent party against a measure of personal income growth during that party’s tenure. As seen in the plot, there appears to be a fairly strong relationship between the economic status under the incumbent party and their share of the 2 party vote.\n\n“Bread and Peace” Raw Data“Bread and Peace” by Year\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot1.1 &lt;- \n  ggplot(election) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = growth, y = vote), size = 2, shape = 22, fill = '#004488', color = '#004488') +\n  labs(x = \"Growth in Personal Income\", y = \"Incumbent vote share\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 11))\nplot1.1\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth in personal income is associated with higher vote shares for the incumbent party\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot1.2 &lt;- \n  ggplot(election) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = growth, y = vote, label = year), size = 3.5, fontface = 'bold', color = '#004488') +\n  labs(x = \"Growth in Personal Income\", y = \"Incumbent vote share\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 11))\nplot1.2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1980 election saw Jimmy Carter lose decsively to Ronald Regan amid a floundering economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven this data we, therefore, have the simple regression equation:\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{1}income + \\epsilon\\]\nWhere the expected two party vote share \\(y\\) is assumed to be a function of the change in personal income growth \\(\\beta_1\\) plus unmeasured residual error \\(\\epsilon\\). So far this isn’t any different than your bog-standard lm(y~x) type model. The difference is how a Bayesian model handles the model parameters. In short, while a frequentist model views parameters as “fixed”, a Bayesian model views them as random variables modeled as draws from a posterior distribution. This posterior distribution is formed from a likelihood (the observed data), and a prior distribution.\nBecause this isn’t meant to be a full introduction to Bayesian inference, feel free to review some good articles here, or here.\n\n\nThe Bayesian approach\nFor our models we have two sets of priors. One is a ‘flat’ prior which is drawn from a uniform distribution. This essentially adds zero additional information to the model. The other we can provide is an “informative” prior that contains some knowledge about the value of the estimates. This can be “weakly-informative” which just keeps the estimates within some reasonable bounds, or truly informative which reflects real-world knowledge. Here, I will add an informative prior to the second model reflecting my belief that a 1% increase in personal income growth is likely to increase vote share by about 3%, which is unlikely to be higher 5% or lower than 1%.\n\n\nCode\n# let's regress!\nfit2_prior &lt;- c(prior(normal(3, 1), class = 'b'))\n\n# model 1 has default (flat) priors on betas\n# 1 percentage point in growth is associated with ~ 3% increase in vote share\nfit1 &lt;-\n  brm(vote ~ growth,\n      data = election,\n      family = \"gaussian\",\n      file = \"hibbs_fit1.Rdata\")\ntidy(fit1) %&gt;% kable(digits = 2, caption = \"Flat prior\")\n\n\n\nFlat prior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect\ncomponent\ngroup\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nconf.low\nconf.high\n\n\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\n(Intercept)\n46.19\n1.75\n42.63\n49.66\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\ngrowth\n3.08\n0.76\n1.54\n4.57\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nResidual\nsd__Observation\n4.05\n0.81\n2.82\n5.97\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# same model, with much tighter priors\n# assuming a mean effect of about 2.5% +- 1.5%\nfit2 &lt;-\n  brm(\n    vote ~ growth,\n    data = election,\n    family = \"gaussian\",\n    prior = fit2_prior,\n    file = \"hibbs_fit2.Rdata\"\n  )\ntidy(fit2) %&gt;% kable(digits = 2, caption = \"Informative prior\")\n\n\n\nInformative prior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect\ncomponent\ngroup\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nconf.low\nconf.high\n\n\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\n(Intercept)\n46.24\n1.51\n43.19\n49.12\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\ngrowth\n3.03\n0.58\n1.91\n4.17\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nResidual\nsd__Observation\n4.01\n0.82\n2.83\n6.04\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at the parameter estimates from the two models we see they are roughly the same. A 1% increase in personal income growth is associated with a 3% increase increase in vote share for the incumbent party. Our choice of prior doesn’t really affect the point estimate, but we can see that restricting the plausible range has shrunk the standard error and credible interval range. This is because we are adding additional data to the model, based on our prior beliefs. Bayesian statistics in action!\n\n\nPredictions for a new value of x\nOf course, we can also create a prediction for y given a new value of x. For example, what would the expected vote share be, given the growth in personal income was 2%? Here we can access the posterior distribution for a prediction of y. This prediction itself is constructed as a distribution from the posterior, which gives us a range of values for the prediction. Below we see the mean prediction for incumbent vote share where \\(x=2\\) is 52.3, but this could plausibly range between as low as 44 or as high as 61.\n\nEstimate DistributionPoint Estimate and Intervals\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# what is the predicted vote share given a 2% growth rate?\n# ~52%, but with a pretty big margin of error\nnewgrowth = 2.0\nnewprobs = c(.025, .25, .75, 0.975)\n\npred1 &lt;- posterior_predict(fit1, newdata = data.frame(growth=newgrowth))\n\nypred = mean(pred1) \nypred_quantile = quantile(pred1, newprobs)\n\n\nggplot(data.frame(x = pred1)) + geom_density(aes(x = x), linewidth = 1, color = '#DDAA33', fill = '#DDAA33', alpha = .2) +\n  labs(x = \"Predicted Vote Share (x=2)\", y = \"Probability Density\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 11))\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of estimates for y, given x = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# plot the 50% and 95% credible intervals for the point estimate of 2% growth\nplot1.1 +\n  annotate(geom = \"linerange\", x = newgrowth, ymin = ypred_quantile[2], ymax = ypred_quantile[3], color = '#DDAA33',  linewidth = 1) +\n  annotate(geom = \"linerange\", x = newgrowth, ymin = ypred_quantile[1], ymax = ypred_quantile[4], color = '#DDAA33') +\n  annotate(geom = \"point\", x = newgrowth, y = ypred, fill = '#DDAA33', color = 'white', stroke = 2, size = 3, shape = 21)\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint estimate, and 50% and 95% credible intervals for x=2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also access simulations for the intercepts and slopes of each model.

I’m not here to discuss any of these things, as many other smart people have already debated this to death (plus, given Hogan is reticent to release his data or code we may never really know exactly what he did).\nHowever, what I do want to discuss is something else Gelman wrote about on his blog:\n\nHogan and the others make comparisons, but the comparisons they make are to that weighted average of Detroit, New Orleans, and New York. The trouble is . . . that’s just 3 cities, and homicide rates can vary a lot from city to city. It just doesn’t make sense to throw away the other 96 cities in your data.

In this method you typically have one large “treated” area - such as a city or state - that implements some kind of policy. You then use other comparably large or similar areas to construct a synthetic version of your treated unit to estimate the counterfactual. It’s an appealing method because it is relatively simple to calculate, fairly transparent about where the weights come from, and has good overlap with more conventional difference-in-differences methods (non-negative weights with a sum-to-one constraint). So in a way, I don’t necessarily have the same issues that Gelman does, but he brings up a good point. By using only large aggregate units there is an inherent loss of information. In the ADH method we sort of assume that by matching closely on the outcome variable we can average over a lot of the confounders. Although in the ADH method you can also match on other covariates - but in my experience the vast majority of the synthetic control weights are derived solely from the pre-treatment outcomes.\n\n\nGelman further writes:\n\nMy understanding of a synthetic controls analysis went like this.

    "text": "An Example: Operation Impact (2014)\nAs a quick demo, here’s an example I presented for part of NIJ’s Smart Suite. The research question posed here is whether a surge in police activity New York City’s 47th precinct reduced assaults or robberies. There were a number of previous iterations of Operation Impact which an evaluation found a general decrease in crime(MacDonald, Fagan, and Geller 2016). The example here looks at a much later surge in 2014:\n\nThe data I organized for this example contains block-level census data from the American Community Survey, as well as monthly counts of some major crime categories (here: assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, robbery, and larceny-theft).

The remainder of the census blocks in the dataset are part of our “donor” pool, which we can use for our synthetic control.\n\nApplying the ‘Microsynth’ approach\nThe R package microsynth does almost all of the heavy lifting(Robbins and Davenport 2021). Without getting too much into the weeds, the general idea here is that we want to re-weight all of our untreated (non-Operation Impact) census blocks in a way that makes them nearly - or exactly - identical to the census blocks in the 47th precinct. Microsynth accomplishes this much in the same way that surveys are weighted to approximate the population of interest. However, instead here we treat the 47th precinct as our “population” and estimate weights to apprxomiate the pre-treatment outcomes and covariates in the treated precinct. The full code to run the model is below:\n\nfit &lt;-\n  microsynth(\n    nyc_impact,\n    idvar = 'geoid',\n    timevar = 'month',\n    intvar = 'impact',\n    start.pre = 1,\n    end.pre = 9,\n    end.post = 12,\n    match.out = c('assault', 'robbery'),\n    match.covar = c(\n      'total_pop',\n      'total_black',\n      'total_hispan',\n      'total_poverty',\n      'total_snap'),\n    result.var = c('assault', 'robbery'),\n    omnibus.var = c('assault', 'robbery'))\n\nAs a start, we can assess whether our synthetic control is appropriately balanced on pre-treatment differences. As we saw above, we matched on both time-varying and non time-varying covariates. Looking at the balance table below we see that we achieved exact balance on all our variables - which is quite good! This should give us more confidence that the outcomes we observe in the post period are due to the intervention, and not a result of systematic differences between treated and control units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTargets\nWeighted.Control\nAll.scaled\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n23\n23\n23.00\n\n\ntotal_pop\n77311\n77311\n89810.67\n\n\ntotal_black\n44079\n44079\n23373.48\n\n\ntotal_hispan\n15693\n15693\n26494.13\n\n\ntotal_poverty\n24022\n24022\n18865.98\n\n\ntotal_snap\n6558\n6558\n4875.89\n\n\nassault.9\n27\n27\n18.56\n\n\nassault.8\n35\n35\n20.69\n\n\nassault.7\n28\n28\n21.13\n\n\nassault.6\n26\n26\n21.10\n\n\nassault.5\n35\n35\n20.43\n\n\nassault.4\n30\n30\n17.44\n\n\nassault.3\n25\n25\n17.57\n\n\nassault.2\n15\n15\n15.14\n\n\nassault.1\n16\n16\n16.22\n\n\nrobbery.9\n30\n30\n15.89\n\n\nrobbery.8\n38\n38\n16.61\n\n\nrobbery.7\n31\n31\n16.19\n\n\nrobbery.6\n26\n26\n14.36\n\n\nrobbery.5\n23\n23\n15.60\n\n\nrobbery.4\n21\n21\n12.91\n\n\nrobbery.3\n18\n18\n13.50\n\n\nrobbery.2\n13\n13\n13.79\n\n\nrobbery.1\n31\n31\n16.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can print out the results as well.

    "section": "Creating a PCA Anomaly Detector",
    "text": "Creating a PCA Anomaly Detector\nLet’s now get into the nuts and bolts of actually creating a PCA-based anomaly detector. Now, there are a few ways we can go about this, but I’m going to rely on the approach suggested by Charu Aggarwal in his book Outlier Analysis. What he essentially proposes is a “soft” version of principal components where the eigenvectors are weighted by their variance instead of choosing only the eigenvectors that explain the highest proportion of the overall variance. This “soft” approach has some overlap with the mahalanobis distance. This is the same approach taken by the PCA anomaly detector in the Python pyod package if weighting is specified.\n\nPerforming the “soft” PCA\nTranslating this approach from the formula to code is actually pretty straightforward. Agarwal gives us the following:\n\\[Score(\\bar{X}) = \\sum^d_{j=1} \\frac{|(\\bar{X} - \\bar{\\mu}) *\\bar{e_j}|^2}{\\lambda_j}\\] Which we can code into the following below. Before we add our data to the PCA we scale it to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 so that the input features are scale-invariant. We then work through the process of extracting the eigenvectors, computing the variance for each, and then performing the “soft” PCA approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA few notes - strictly speaking the the part \\(\\bar{X} - \\bar{\\mu}\\) isn’t totally necessary in most cases because the eigenvectors are already scaled to have a mean of zero (you can also ensure this by specifying cor=TRUE in the princomp() function). This does help in unusual cases where \\(\\bar{\\mu}\\) is not zero.\n\n\n\n# \"Soft\" PCA\n\n# scale input attributes\nX &lt;- df[, 2:7]\nX &lt;- scale(X)\n\n# pca anomaly detection\n# extract eigenvectors & variance\npca &lt;- princomp(X, cor = TRUE)\ne &lt;- pca$scores\nev &lt;- diag(var(e))\nmu &lt;- apply(e, 2, mean)\nn &lt;- ncol(e)\n\n# compute anomaly scores\nalist &lt;- vector(mode = \"list\", length = n)\nfor(i in 1:n){\n  alist[[i]] &lt;- abs( (e[, i] - mu[i])^2 / ev[i])\n}\n\n# extract values & export\nXscore &lt;- as.matrix(do.call(cbind, alist))\nanom &lt;- apply(Xscore, 1, sum)\n\nThis “soft” PCA is in contrast to so-called “hard” PCA where a specific number of principal components are chosen and the remainder are discarded. The “hard” PCA primarily focuses on reconstruction error along the components with the most variance, while the “soft” approach weights outliers on the lower variance components higher. This is useful because the data vary much less on these components, so outliers are often more obvious along these dimensions.\n\n\nCode\npca$scores %&gt;%\n  data.frame() %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Comp\")) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = value), bins = 30, fill = '#004488') +\n  facet_wrap(~name, scales = \"free_x\")+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\nOutliers are often more visable along components with lower variance.\n\n\n\n\nThe code below implements the PCA anomaly detector. Most of the work involves taking the scores, putting them into a matrix, and then re-weighting them by their variance. The final score is just the row-wise sum across the re-weighted columns. The output is just a vector of anomaly scores anom.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(tibble(anom)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = anom), bins = 25, color = 'white', fill = '#004488')+\n  labs(x = \"Anomaly Score\", y = \"Observations\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of outlier scores. More anomalous observations have higher scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlagging Outliers\nFor flagging outliers we can rely on the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution. This is handy because the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is formed as the sum of the squares of \\(d\\) independent standard normal random variables. For the purposes of this example we might just choose 1% as our threshold for anomalies. After flagging we can plot the data along different 2d distributions to see where they lie. For example, the 8 anomalous hospitals generally have both longer stay lengths and charge more for comparable procedures relative to other hospitals.\n\n\nCode\n# compute a p-value for anomalies and\n# append anomaly score and p-values to new dataframe\np = sapply(anom, pchisq, df=6, ncp = mean(anom), lower.tail=F)\n\nscored_data &lt;- data.frame(df, anom, p)\n\nflag &lt;- scored_data$p &lt;= 0.01\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = scored_data, aes(x = stay_len, y = diff), color = '#004488', size = 2, alpha = .25) +\n  geom_point(data = scored_data[flag,], aes(x = stay_len, y = diff), color = '#BB5566', size = 2.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Stay Length\", y = \"Avg. Payment Difference\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting inliers (blue) and outliers (red) in 2D space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCA Anaomaly Detector: Example Function\nHere’s a minimal working example of the procedure above. As we build our ensemble, we’ll come back to this function later.\n\n\nCode\n# Run a principal components anomaly detector\nadPCA &lt;- function(X){\n  \n  # pca anomaly detection\n  # extract eigenvectors & variance\n  pca &lt;- princomp(X, cor = TRUE)\n  e &lt;- pca$scores\n  ev &lt;- diag(var(e))\n  mu &lt;- apply(e, 2, mean)\n  n &lt;- ncol(e)\n  \n  # compute anomaly scores\n  alist &lt;- vector(mode = \"list\", length = n)\n  for(i in 1:n){\n    alist[[i]] &lt;- abs( (e[, i] - mu[i])^2 / ev[i])\n  }\n  \n  # extract values & export\n  Xscore &lt;- as.matrix(do.call(cbind, alist))\n  anom &lt;- apply(Xscore, 1, sum)\n  \n  return(anom)\n}"

    "text": "Doing it with SMOTE\nSo the argument with SMOTE is that training models on data sets with very large imbalances in positive vs. negative cases is that the models only learn from the negative cases and not the positive ones. A good example might be a fraud data set where you have 100,000 legitimate credit card transactions and only 500 cases of fraud (so something like .5%). SMOTE is intended to help with training a model by synthesizing a balanced data set where the ratio of positive to negative cases are much closer to 50/50. Without going too much into it, this actually rarely solves and problems and often induces some.\nWhat I suspect the authors of this paper did is that they generated a SMOTE data set with a balanced ratio of positive to negative cases, then created a test-train split from that data set, and evaluated their metrics on a test data set derived from the SMOTE model. That is very, very wrong.\n\nDoing SMOTE the wrong way\nSo let’s try it. I’ll synthesize a SMOTE data set from the full set of cases, then walk through the whole process using only the synthesized data.

It is much easier to perform classification on data that are artificially balanced. However, actually using these models in real life entails data that almost never follow this.\nFinally, I don’t mean to focus on these authors specifically. The analysis they are doing is with some good intentions, but is mostly misguided. The data here are mostly unsuited for examining more complex models and processes. In addition, what I see here is a common issue for many data analysts, which is why being thoughtful and careful at the start of your analysis is very important."

    "section": "Predicting Elderly Falls from Medical Narratives",
    "text": "Predicting Elderly Falls from Medical Narratives\nFor this example I am going to rely on some data from DrivenData - an organization that hosts data competitions. The data here are verified fall events for adults aged 65+. This sample comes more broadly from the National Electronic Injury Survellience System(NEISS). This is useful because the sample of cases here are human-verified falls cases, in which case we have a source of truth. While you could probably get pretty far just doing some regex like str.match(\"FALL|FELL|SLIPPED\") but it would likely miss more subtle cases. This is where having something like a BERT model is useful.\nLet’s say we have a set of verified falls narratives (which we do) and we have a large set of miscellanous narratives that contain falls cases, as well as other injuries that are not falls. Our goal is to find narratives that are likely to be related to elderly fall cases. To do this, we will use the verified falls cases narratives from DataDriven as our “training data” so to speak, and we will use an NLP model to find cases that are semantically similar to these verified falls cases.\n\nData Setup\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport re\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util\n\nnp.random.seed(1)\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')\n\n# load raw data\nfalls = pd.read_csv(\"../../../data/falls/falls.csv\")\nneis = pd.read_csv(\"../../../data/falls/neis.csv\")\n\n# process datetime\nfalls['treatment_date'] = pd.to_datetime(falls['treatment_date'])\n\nTo get set up we read in the verified falls narratives, as well as the full sample of NEIS cases from 2022. After reading in our data we can perform some minor data cleaning to the narratives. Specifically, because we want to isolate narrative characterics associated with falls we should exclude the leading information about the patient’s age and sex, as well as some other medical terminology. We can also remap some abbreviations to English and properly extract the actual age of the patient from the narrative.\n\n# define remappings of abbreviations\n# and strings to remove from narratives\n\nremap = {\n    \"FX\": \"FRACTURE\",\n    \"INJ\": \"INJURY\",\n    \"LAC\": \"LACERATION\",\n    \"CONT\": \"CONTUSION\",\n    \"CHI\" : \"CLOSED HEAD INJURY\",\n    \"ETOH\": \"ALCOHOL\",\n    \"SDH\": \"SUBDURAL HEMATOMA\",\n    \"NH\": \"NURSING HOME\",\n    \"PT\": \"PATIENT\",\n    \"LT\": \"LEFT\",\n    \"RT\": \"RIGHT\",\n    \"&\" : \" AND \"\n}\nstr_remove = \"YOM|YOF|MOM|MOF|C/O|S/P|H/O|DX\"\n\n\ndef process_text(txt):\n    words = txt.split()\n    new_words = [remap.get(word, word) for word in words]\n    txt = \" \".join(new_words)\n\n    txt = re.sub(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\", txt)\n    txt = re.sub(str_remove, \"\", txt)\n\n    return re.sub(r\"^\\s+\", \"\", txt)\n\ndef narrative_age(string):\n    age = re.match(\"^\\d+\",string)\n\n    if not age:\n        age = 0\n    else:\n        age = age[0]\n        \n    return age\n\nWe then apply these to our verified falls data and our raw NEIS data from 2022:\n\n# process narrative text and extract patient age from narrative\nfalls['processed_narrative'] = falls['narrative'].apply(process_text)\nneis['processed_narrative'] = neis['Narrative_1'].apply(process_text)\n\nfalls['narrative_age'] = falls['narrative'].apply(narrative_age).astype(int)\nneis['narrative_age'] = neis['Narrative_1'].apply(narrative_age).astype(int)\n\n# neis cases are from 2022, remove from verified falls\nfalls = falls[falls['treatment_date'] &lt; \"2022-01-01\"]\n\n# filter narrative ages to 65+\nfalls = falls[falls['narrative_age'] &gt;= 65]\nneis = neis[neis['narrative_age'] &gt;= 65]\n\nWe can see that our coding changes the narratives subtly. For example this string:\n\nfalls['narrative'][15]\n\n'87YOF HAD A FALL TO THE FLOOR AT THE NH STRUCK BACK OF HEAD HEMATOMA TO SCALP'\n\n\nIs changed to this:\n\nfalls['processed_narrative'][15]\n\n'HAD A FALL TO THE FLOOR AT THE NURSING HOME STRUCK BACK OF HEAD HEMATOMA TO SCALP'\n\n\nThis minimal amount of pre-processing should help the model identify similar cases without being affected by too much extranenous information. In addition, because the typical model has about 30,000 words encoded we need to make sure we avoid abbreviations which will be absent from the model dictionary.\n\n\nImplementing the Transformer model\nWe can grab all of our verified fall narratives as well as a random sample of narratives from the 2022 NEIS data. Below we’ll take a sample of 250 cases and run them through our model.\n\nN = 250\nidx = np.random.choice(neis.shape[0], N, replace=False)\n\nfall_narrative = np.array(falls['processed_narrative'])\nneis_narrative = np.array(neis['processed_narrative'])[idx]\n\nWe take the processed narratives and convert them to tokens using the pre-trained sentence transformer:\n\nembed_train = model.encode(fall_narrative)\nembed_test = model.encode(neis_narrative)\n\nWe then compute the cosine similarity between the two tensors. What we will end up with is the distance from our NEIS narratives and the verified fall cases. Cases with larger distances should be less likely to contain information about elderly fall cases.\n\ncos_sim = util.cos_sim(embed_test, embed_train)\n\nFor simplicity we scale the distances between 0 and 1, so that 1 is most similar and 0 is least similar. We can then just compare the rank-ordered narratives.\n\ndists = cos_sim.mean(1)\nd_min, d_max = dists.min(), dists.max()\n\ndists = (dists - d_min)/(d_max - d_min)\ndists = np.array(dists)\n\nout = dict(zip(neis_narrative, dists)) \n\nPlotting a histogram of the minmax scaled cosine similarity scores shows a lot of narratives that are very similar and a long tail of those that are not so similar. Of course, there isn’t a single cut point of what we would consider acceptable for classification purposes, but we could certainly use these scores in a regression to determine a suitible cut point if we were so interested.\n\n\nCode\ncparams = {\n    \"axes.spines.left\": False,\n    \"axes.spines.right\": False,\n    \"axes.spines.top\": False,\n    \"axes.spines.bottom\": False,\n    \"grid.linestyle\": \"--\"\n}\n\nsns.set_theme(style=\"ticks\", rc = cparams)\n\n(\n    sns.histplot(dists, color=\"#004488\"),\n    plt.xlabel(\"Cosine Similarity (minmax scaled)\")\n)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nTime to actually see the results. Our results are stored in a dictionary which allows us to just pull narratives by similarity score. Let’s test it out by looking at the top 10 most similar NEIS narratives:\n\nsorted(out, key=out.get, reverse=True)[:10]\n\n['FELL TO THE FLOOR AT THE NURSING HOME  CLOSED HEAD INJURY',\n 'FELL ON THE FLOOR  CLOSED HEAD INJURY',\n 'WAS AT THE NURSING HOME AND SLIPPED AND FELL TO THE FLOOR STRIKING HIS HEAD  SCALP LACERATION',\n 'PRESENTS AFTER A FALL WHILE WALKING ACROSS THE LIVING ROOM AND HE TRIPPED AND FELL TO THE FLOOR REPORTS HE HIT HIS HEAD AND LEFT SHOULDER ON A RUG  FALL CLOSED FRACTURE OF CERVICAL VERTEBRA',\n 'FELL TO THE FLOOR STRUCK HEAD  CLOSED HEAD INJURY ABRASION TO KNEES',\n 'WAS GETTING INTO BED AND FELL TO THE FLOOR ONTO HEAD  CLOSED HEAD INJURY',\n 'FELL ON FLOOR AT NH INJURY  AND  BODY PATIENT NS  FALL',\n 'FELL BACKWARDS FROM  STEPS CLOSED HEAD INJURY ABRASION HAND',\n 'PRESENTS WITH HEAD INJURY AFTER A FALL REPORTS HE WAS FOUND ON THE FLOOR IN A RESTAURANT AFTER HE SLIPPED AND FELL HITTING HIS HEAD  INJURY OF HEAD',\n 'WENT TO SIT DOWN AND SOMEONE MOVED HER CHAIR AND SHE FELL BACKWARDS HITTING HER HEAD ON THE FLOOR  FALL BLUNT HEAD TRAUMA TAIL BONE PAIN']\n\n\nAnd the 10 least similar narratives:\n\nsorted(out, key=out.get, reverse=False)[:10]\n\n['SYNCOPAL EPISODE WHILE FOLDING NS CLOTHINGSYNCOPE',\n 'WAS COOKING SOME SALMON AND THEN SPRAYED A  AEROSOL DEODORANT DUE TO THE SMELL WHICH CAUSED HER TO FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS STUCK IN HER THROAT FOREIGN BODY SENSATION IN THROAT',\n 'WAS PLAYING GOLF AND DEVELOPED AMS AND PASSED OUT  SYNCOPE',\n 'CO STABBING RIGHT CHEST PAIN RADIATES TO HER BACK SHORTNESS OF BREATH AFTER HER HHA WAS MOPPING THE FLOOR LAST NIGHT W STRONGPOTENT CLEANING AGENT THAT TRIGGERED HER ASTHMA  CHEST PAIN ASTHMA',\n 'WITH FISH HOOK IN HIS RIGHT INDEX FNIGER HAPPENED AT A LAKE FB RIGHT INDEX FINGER',\n 'CUT THUMB WITH BROKEN BOTTLE NO OTHER DETAILS LWOT NO ',\n 'EXERCISING FELT PAIN IN RIGHT LOWER LEG  LOWER LEG PAIN',\n 'CO LEFT SIDED CHEST PAIN FOR THE PAST THREE DAYS AFTER WORKING OUT AT THE GYM  LEFT PECTORALIS MUSCLE STRAIN',\n 'PRESENTS AFTER BEING IN A ROOM FILLED WITH SMOKE FOR  HOURS AFTER THERE WAS A FIRE IN HER NEIGHBORS APARTMENT UNKNOWN IF FIRE DEPARTMENT INVOLVED  SMOKE INHALATION PAIN IN THROAT ELEVATED TROPONIN',\n 'ON  FOR AF WAS WASHING DISHES AND SLASHED ARM ON A KNIFE  LACERATION OF RIGHT FOREARM']\n\n\nSo in general, it did a pretty good job. The most similar cases are all clearly related to falls, while the least similar ones are all a mix of other injuries. While I don’t have any tests here (coming soon!) I suspect this does better than very simple regex queries. If only because it has the ability to find similarities without needing to match on specific strings."

For example, the search query is \"SLIPPED IN BATHTUB\" but we get results like \"FELL IN THE SHOWER\" and \"SLIP AND FALL IN THE TUB\". If we were looking specifically for passages related to falls in the bathtub these obviously make sense (many bathtubs are also just showers as well)."

In simple terms, this means that the intensity of the point pattern \\(lambda\\) is not constant across the study region. Logically this makes sense because gas stations are typically confined to commercial areas and don’t appear randomly in the middle of parks or waterways.\nIn R this is easy to do. We can calculate the intensity of gas station locations by computing the kernel density of observed locations, and then use those density values as input for our simulation. We can do the same for robberies as well.\n\n\nCode\n# convert to ppp for spatial stuff\nhartford_sp &lt;- as.owin(hartford)\n\ngas_ppp &lt;- as.ppp(gas, W = hartford_sp)\nmarks(gas_ppp) &lt;- \"gas\"\n\nrobbery_ppp &lt;- as.ppp(robbery, W = hartford_sp)\nmarks(robbery_ppp) &lt;- \"robbery\"\n\ngas_robbery_ppp &lt;- superimpose(gas_ppp, robbery_ppp, W = hartford_sp)\nmarks(gas_robbery_ppp) &lt;- factor(marks(gas_robbery_ppp))\n\n\n# calculate the density of gas stations & robberies\n# replace negative values with 0\ngas_density &lt;- density.ppp(gas_ppp, sigma = 750)\ngas_density[gas_density &lt; 0] &lt;- 0\n\nrobbery_density &lt;- density.ppp(robbery_ppp, sigma = 500)\nrobbery_density[robbery_density &lt; 0] &lt;- 0\n\n\nWe can plot the density of gas station locations.

What we can do is compute the clustering intensity of the observed point pattern, and then compare that to our simulations.\n\n\nCode\nN_SIM &lt;- 100\nN_GAS &lt;- nrow(gas)\n\n# observed K-function for gas stations\ngas_kest &lt;- Kest(gas_ppp)\n\n# simulate gas stations\n# generate 100 simulations\ngas_sim &lt;- rpoispp(gas_density,nsim = N_SIM)\nrobbery_sim &lt;- rpoispp(robbery_density, nsim = N_SIM)\n\n\nThis gives us the observed K function for gas stations.\n\n\nCode\nplot(gas_kest)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can simulate. So we’re going to take the observed density values as probabilities for an inhomogeneous Poisson point process.\n\n\nCode\n# simulate gas stations\n# generate 100 simulations\ngas_sim &lt;- rpoispp(gas_density,nsim = N_SIM)\n\n# get N gas stations generated\n# and intensity of generated function\nsim_N &lt;- sapply(gas_sim, function(x){as.numeric(x$n) })\nsim_L &lt;- lapply(gas_sim, Kest, correction = \"border\", r = gas_kest$r)\n\n# plot envelopes against observed\nX &lt;- sapply(sim_L, function(x){x$border})\n\nXdf &lt;- as.data.frame(X)\nXdf$r &lt;- gas_kest$r\n\n\n# Plot observed K against simulations of K\nobs_K &lt;- data.frame(r = gas_kest$r,\n                    K = gas_kest$border)\n\n\nThis plots the minimum and maximum envelopes (in grey) of the simulations against the observed K values in red. In general, we see that the pairwise relationships between gas stations is fairly close to observed, expect at small spatial scales. We appear to be failing to simulate cases where many gas stations are near each other (such as at 4 way intersections with a station on each corner).\n\n\nCode\nXdf %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-r, names_to = \"simulation\", values_to = \"K\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(r) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Kmin = min(K),\n            Kmax = max(K)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(x = r, ymin = Kmin, ymax = Kmax), alpha = .3) +\n  geom_line(data = obs_K, aes(x = r, y = K), linewidth = 1, color = 'red') + \n  labs(y = 'K(Border)', x = 'Distance (feet)') +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n100 Simulation envelopes (grey) compared to observed K (red)\n\n\n\n\nWe can also plot the points directly and see what they look like:\n\n\nCode\n#| warning: false\nsim_gas_points &lt;-\n  st_as_sf(\n    data.frame(x = gas_sim$`Simulation 10`$x, y = gas_sim$`Simulation 10`$y),\n    coords = c(\"x\", \"y\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  `st_crs&lt;-`(. , st_crs(gas))\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = hartford, fill = 'grey90', color = 'white') +\n  geom_sf(data = robbery, color = \"#EE6677\", size = 1, alpha = .3) +\n  geom_sf(data = sim_gas_points, color = \"#4477AA\", size = 2) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved robberies and simulated gas station locations"

We can clearly see that while our simulated data is fairly close to the observed pattern for most distances 1000 feet and beyond, there is much less clustering at small spatial scales. This makes sense, because of how crime is often geo-coded. When you have crimes that occur directly on the location they will typically share the same coordinates. In our case, our points are more spread out than we would expect to see in real life.\nWhether or not this data is “good enough” will depend on the use case at hand. In many cases very rough synthetic data can suffice for many purposes. In other cases, where high-fidelity synthetic data is needed, considerably more post-processing is required to bring the synthetic data in line with the real."

    "title": "I Made An Election Model",
    "section": "My Model",
    "text": "My Model\nTo keep it simple, I focused on the simplest kind of model - a poll aggregation model estimating national vote for the two-party candidates. This approach avoids a lot of additional complexity of estimating electoral college votes by not having to model state-level vote share, correlations between states, and many other things. This was truly just meant for a bit of academic fun. As a source of data, I used the very nicely curated tables supplied by 538 here, which was continuously updated during the election cycle. Helpfully, this data contains some other useful variables such as information about pollsters, and 538’s own ranking of pollster’s reliability.\nFor my model I applied filtering to get a subset of polls:\n\nOnly polls that included a Trump-Harris match up\nPolls that were conducted just before Biden dropped out (6/1/2024)\nOnly polls including likely voters, registered voters, or adults\nRemoved overlapping polls\nPolls with larger than 5,000 respondents\n\nDropping polls with more than 5,000 respondents is largely an approach to remove pollsters who “dredge” for lots of responses that are often typically of low quality. In total, this leaves us with about 255 unique polls in the 165 days between 6/1/2024 and 11/4/2024.\n\nThe poll aggregation approach\nFor the modelling approach I drew some inspiration from Andrew Gelman and others. Most of the current poll aggregation models apply some form of hierarchical linear modelling (HLM), combined with time trends, and often a “fundamentals” component. The general idea here is to partially pool information from many different pollsters, who are all utilizing slightly different samples of the population, with slightly different approaches.\nFor any individual poll we want to weight its contribution to the daily estimate based on known variables that affect responses (e.g: is this a partisan poll? is the poll registered or likely voters?), as well as “random” factors that sum to a distribution around a mean value (the distribution of responses by day, and by pollster). In addition, I wanted a model that also updated based on smooth time trends. While there are some nifty approaches using things like random-walk priors, I opted for a very simple cubic spine regression.\n\n\nFitting the models\nTo do this we fit the HLM component by applying fixed effects for partisan identification, the survey method (online, phone, or other), and the self-identified voting population (registered voters, likely voters, or adults). We apply varying intercepts for a day indicator, as well as for a pollster indicator. These varying intercepts apply partial pooling for each polling day as well as for pollster effects. In short, what this does is help pull polling estimates toward a group-level mean, and helps avoid any individual poll pulling the estimates too far in one direction - which is often referred to as “shrinkage”. I’ve actually written about this before in a blog post about estimating rare injury rates. We also fit a very simple cubic spline regression with default brms parameters. The idea here is to get smoothed estimates over time to account for a baseline trend of public opinion.\nWe do all the model fitting using brms using a binomial regression model in the form n_votes |trials(pop) where n_votes is the predicted number of votes for a candidate given a survey sample size pop. Finally, we also weight the polls based on their numeric grade assigned by 538. An example brms model looks something like the following below:\n\n\nCode\n# fitting a poll aggregation model for harris\nfit2.1 &lt;-\n  brm(\n    n_votes |\n      trials(pop) + weights(W_dem) ~ 1 + partisan + method + vtype +\n      (1 | index_t) +\n      (1 | index_p),\n    family = \"binomial\",\n    data = all_polls_df[dem, ],\n    data2 = list(W_dem = W_dem),\n    prior = bprior,\n    chains = 4,\n    cores = 4,\n    file = \"data\\\\election_model\\\\fit2.1\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc weighting\nI likely deviated from accepted statistical dogma here by weighting the smoothing spline model and HLM using very ad-hoc approach. Early on I decided that I wanted my estimates to be mostly evenly controlled by the HLM and the smoothing spline, but I felt that the smoothing time trend would help eliminate a lot of the spikes on a day-to-day basic. I opted for a 60/40 weighting scheme that gave slightly more weight to the smoothing model. As you can see below, the combined “post-hoc” weighted predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoothing spline model predictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical linear model predictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc weighted predictions (60/40)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor clarity, we can add all the individual poll results showing the estimated support for Harris and Trump, with the size weighted by the number of respondents (larger polls get larger circles). Shown below, on the last day before the election we estimate a popular vote of 49.1% for Trump and 48.9% for Harris. Including the uncertainty basically makes estimating the winner essentially a coinflip.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredicted popular vote for Harris and Trump, as of 11/4/2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nAnd below we have a table showing the estimated results for the last day of polling on 11/14/2025.\n\n\n\nElection day estimates, national popular vote\n\n\nparty\nend\nymin\nmedian\nymax\n\n\n\n\nDEM\n2024-11-04\n47.34\n48.92\n50.59\n\n\nREP\n2024-11-04\n47.49\n49.11\n50.76\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at my estimates, compared to the final count (as of 1/9/2025) the point estimates my model came up with are quite close to the observed results (Trump at 49.9% vs 49.1%, Harris at 48.9% vs 48.4%). Getting within a percentage point of the true value is pretty good, I think for a somewhat half-baked model! That being said, for the purposes of predicting who would ultimately win the day of, the margin of error on the predictions give us essentially no additional confidence beyond a 50/50 chance. This is pretty consistent with a lot of other pollsters who had fancier models. In the end, it was a very close election that was decided by a relatively small number of voters in key areas."

    "text": "Setting up the Project\n\nNEISS Injury and Product Narratives\nLet’s start with straightforward task for the LLM. For this blog post I rely on the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) 2024 dataset. This data contains information about injuries reported to a representative sample of hospitals across the U.S. The data contains information about the person who was injured, including a short narrative from the hospital, which is useful for our purposes. The narratives look something like this:\n\n70YOM WAS DRINKING ALCOHOL AND TRIPPED AND FELL CAUSING HIS ARM TO GO THROUGH A GLASS WINDOW, DX: LT FOREARM LACERATION\n\nIn addition to the narratives, another set of fields are listings of various “products” that were related to the injury (Product_1 to Product_3). These are referred to as the the “external cause” of the injury. The NEISS coding manualy provides the following definition as the “external cause”:\n\n…the existence of a medical condition which can be associated with a specific object or acute process that was caused by something outside the body\n\nSo, for this specific example above, the product coded for this injury was 1894 - WINDOWS AND WINDOW GLASS, OTHER THAN STORM WINDOWS. Here, the external cause is the glass that was broken by the patient’s arm which caused a laceration to the forearm.\nSo how is the product chosen? Well, this can be a bit tricky. First off, the NEISS coding manual contains over 800 different products. A small sampling shows:\n101 - WASHING MACHINES WITHOUT WRINGERS OR OTHER DRYERS\n102 - WRINGER WASHING MACHINES\n103 - WASHING MACHINES WITH UNHEATED SPIN DRYERS\n106 - ELECTRIC CLOTHES DRYERS WITHOUT WASHERS\n107 - GAS CLOTHES DRYERS WITHOUT WASHERS\n108 - MANGLE IRONS\n110 - ELECTRIC HEATING PADS\n112 - SEWING MACHINES OR ACCESSORIES\n113 - FLOOR BUFFERS OR WAXERS\n114 - RUG SHAMPOOERS\n115 - VACUUM CLEANERS\n116 - ELECTRIC BROOMS\n118 - GAS WATER HEATERS\n119 - ELECTRIC WATER HEATERS\n125 - WATER SOFTENERS OR CONDITIONERS (APPLIANCES)\n126 - WASHING MACHINES, NOT SPECIFIED\n127 - CLOTHES DRYERS, NOT SPECIFIED\n\n\nIdentifying the “external cause”\nThe large variety of possible options highlights an interesting question. If we wanted an LLM to read the injury case narratives and tag each case with the appropriate product, how feasible would this be? Could we do it with a very cheap model? There are a few possible issues to consider here:\n\nThere are a very large number of possible products from which we can choose, but only one “correct” answer.\nMany of the products are very subtly different from each other. For example, how do we easily distinguish between 610 - NONGLASS BATHTUBS OR SHOWERS and 611 - BATHTUBS OR SHOWERS (a bit of a hint for later)?\nA narrative can have many products involved in an injury, but we have to choose the product that is most related to that injury.\n\nHere’s a clearer way to illustrate the problem. Read this narrative below and guess which product was related to this injury. For simplicity I am narrowing it down to four options.\n\n64YOF, NINE DAYS AGO WAS STANDING ON A CHAIR HANGING HOLIDAY DECORATIONS WHEN SHE FELL ONTO LEFT HIP AND SINCE THEN HAS LOW BACK PAIN, DX: LOW BACK PAIN\n\n\n1714 - SEASONAL DECORATIONS\n4074 - CHAIRS, OTHER OR NOT SPECIFIED\n1807 - FLOORS OR FLOORING MATERIALS\n4025 - BARSTOOLS OR KITCHEN STOOLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is “b”: 4074 - CHAIRS, OTHER OR NOT SPECIFIED"

    "text": "Labeling Narratives with ChatGPT\nTo start, I’ll run quickly through my initial approach to this problem, using ChatGPT via the OpenAI python library. My idea is to do the following:\n\nConstruct a prompt that narrowly focuses the AI to identify the product that is most proximate to the injury\nUse RAG to give the AI a narrower list of products to choose from\nReview the results, then build a fine-tuned version of the model, based on steps 1&2.\n\nToday we’ll focus just on the first two steps, before we get into fine tuning. I’ll walk through a few key functions in my code, but if you want to look at the whole setup, you can just navigate to the working environment on my repo.\n\nParameters, Roles, and Prompts\nIn my prepare_batch.py file I first define some important parameters for setting up the RAG model, as well as defining the LLM’s role:\n\nRUN_DATE = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\nNUM_NARRATIVES = 500\nRAG_MODEL = SentenceTransformer(\"all-mpnet-base-v2\")\nMODEL = \"gpt-4o-mini\"\nROLE = \"\"\"You are an expert medical grader. Your goal is to read incident narratives and \nextract structured output based on the information available in the narrative field. Your\nPRIMARY GOAL is to determine the product that is MOST PROXIMATE to the injury reported in\nthe narrative. You MUST choose only from the provided list of products and return the \nEXACT product name and produce code in your answer.\n\"\"\"\n\n# define regex to extract the core narrative for RAG\nCORE_NARRATIVE_REGEX = re.compile(\"\\d{1,3}\\s?[A-Z]{2,4}[,]?\\s+(.*?)(?=\\s*DX:)\")\n\n# Load stopwords\nSTOPWORDS = set(stopwords.words(\"english\"))\n\nHere, I set up a RAG model using sentence transformers, and choose a cheap model from OpenAI’s model library. I choose the cheapest available model which is gpt-4o-mini (at a cost of a measley 15 cents per million tokens!). The system role I define instructs the LLM to find the injury that is “most proximate” to the injury reported in the narrative. Finally, I have some regex to extract out just the core narrative (excluding the injury description) to pass to the RAG model for retriving a list of possible products.\nI set up a bunch of helper functions (see the repo if you’re interested), but the important one is the prompt creator. This function takes as input a text narrative from a single injury case, as well as the RAG that gives the LLM a list of possible products to choose.\n\ndef create_prompt(neiss_incident, neiss_product_codes):\n\n    prompt = f\"\"\"Closely follow the numbered instructions to perform your evaluation of the narrative.\n\n        ## NARRATIVE\n        1.

The goal is to provide a wide variety of products that should be at least somewhat related to the narrative. This saves us a lot of tokens from not embedding the entire list of products (which is close to 9000 tokens), and helps our cheap model’s performance by shortening the context window.\nAnd, finally, the output I expect to get is in json format:\n'{\"primary_injury\": \"MUSCLE STRAIN LEFT SHOULDER\", \"product\": \"SOCCER (activity, apparel or equipment)\", \"product_code\": 1267}'\n\n\nFull workflow\nAll right, time for the full workflow.

    "section": "Evaluation",
    "text": "Evaluation\nOf course, the major question is how did our cheap model do? To evaluate it, we need to load our batch output back in after it has been run through the OpenAI batch API. For simplicity I just convert it from a jsonlines file to a pandas dataframe. I also load in the original data as well from the NEISS table, as well as the original list of product codes. To keep this simple (I am just doing this for fun, on my own blog after all) I restrict the evaluation metrics to whether the LLM correctly identified any of the 3 possible products listed for an injury. This is more in line with how they are coded by humans. According to the NEISS coding manual:\n\nWhen multiple products are involved, it does not matter in what order you enter them.\n\nSo, for our purposes, I’ll be satisfied if the LLM’s listed primary product lines up with any of the products in the data.\n\n# load the first 500 cases and product codes\nneiss_df = pd.read_csv(neiss_data).head(500)\nproduct_codes = load_product_codes(neiss_codes)\n\n\n# load output, set up vector database and original data\nfile = \"json/batch_682f2331c2fc81908ea42a70bf77709c_output.jsonl\"\njson_batch_output, narrative_ids = load_batch(file)\n\n# converting output to datafraames\nproduct_codes_df = pd.DataFrame(product_codes)\nproduct_codes_df['code'] = product_codes_df['code'].astype(int)\n\nneiss_df = neiss_df.merge(product_codes_df, how='left', left_on='Product_1', right_on='code') \\\n                   .rename(columns={'product_title': 'product_title_1'}) \\\n                   .merge(product_codes_df, how='left', left_on='Product_2', right_on='code') \\\n                   .rename(columns={'product_title': 'product_title_2'}) \\\n                   .merge(product_codes_df, how='left', left_on='Product_3', right_on='code') \\\n                   .rename(columns={'product_title': 'product_title_3'})\n\nneiss_df = neiss_df[[\n    'CPSC_Case_Number', 'Product_1', 'Product_2', 'Product_3',\n    'product_title_1', 'product_title_2', 'product_title_3', 'Narrative_1'\n]]\n\n# get llm output into a dataframe\nllm_output_dataframe = pd.DataFrame([json.loads(json_str) for json_str in json_batch_output])\nllm_output_dataframe['CPSC_Case_Number'] = list(map(int, narrative_ids))\n\n# Rename fields\nllm_output_dataframe = llm_output_dataframe.rename(columns={\n    'product': 'llm_product',\n    'product_code': 'llm_product_code'\n})\n\n# now flag, add a label for hit or miss\nllm_output_dataframe['label'] = (\n    (llm_output_dataframe['llm_product_code'] == neiss_df['Product_1'].astype(int)) |\n    (llm_output_dataframe['llm_product_code'] == neiss_df['Product_2'].astype(int)) |\n    (llm_output_dataframe['llm_product_code'] == neiss_df['Product_3'].astype(int))\n)\n\naccuracy = llm_output_dataframe['label'].mean()\n\nHere’s the LLM output in a pandas dataframe. I grab the LLM’s primary injury, the product name, and the product code. I can then compare this to the original labels, keeping in mind that I’m only interested in the Product_1 code.\n\nprint(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}')\n\nAccuracy: 66.40%\n\n\nAn initial accuracy here at about 66%. Not great, but not terrible for a first pass. This will be the baseline value I use before building out a fine-tuned model.\n\nDigging a bit deeper\nSo one important thing to consider is where the model did well, and where it fell short. Before starting on any fine-tuning, it would be helpful to look for areas where there are obvious shortcomings and set up the LLM with examples to help guide it toward more “correct” answers.\nFirst, there are the original NEISS fields (Narrative_1, Product_1, product_title_1) merged with the LLM labeled ones (product_code, product), and a flag for whether the LLM’s guess at the primary product was correct or not (label).\n\n\nCode\n# merge and re-order\ncol_order = ['CPSC_Case_Number','Narrative_1', 'Product_1', 'Product_2', 'Product_3','product_title_1', 'llm_product_code', 'llm_product','label']\nllm_output_dataframe = llm_output_dataframe.merge(neiss_df, on = \"CPSC_Case_Number\")\nllm_output_dataframe = llm_output_dataframe[col_order]\nllm_output_dataframe.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPSC_Case_Number\nNarrative_1\nProduct_1\nProduct_2\nProduct_3\nproduct_title_1\nllm_product_code\nllm_product\nlabel\n\n\n\n\n0\n240108461\n16YOM PLAYING SOCCER, HURT HIS SHOULDER.

Here, I group up the products by the LLM’s labeled product code, then get the proportion correct. As an example, 34 out of 34 times that the LLM guessed the product was 1807 FLOORS OR FLOORING MATERIALS it got it correct, and 25 out of 26 times for 4076 BEDS OR BEDFRAMES, OTHER OR NOT SPECIFIED. Among the top 5 products the results aren’t too bad, although it misclassifies knives slightly more often.\n\n\nCode\nllm_output_dataframe.groupby(['llm_product_code', 'llm_product']).agg(\n    label_mean=('label', 'mean'),\n    label_count=('label', 'count')\n).sort_values('label_count', ascending=False).head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlabel_mean\nlabel_count\n\n\nllm_product_code\nllm_product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1807\nFLOORS OR FLOORING MATERIALS\n1.000000\n34\n\n\n4076\nBEDS OR BEDFRAMES, OTHER OR NOT SPECIFIED\n0.961538\n26\n\n\n1842\nSTEPS OR STAIRS (EXCLUDING PULL-DOWN AND FOLDING STAIRS)\n1.000000\n19\n\n\n464\nKNIVES, NOT ELSEWHERE CLASSIFIED\n0.733333\n15\n\n\n679\nSOFAS, COUCHES, DAVENPORTS, DIVANS OR STUDIO COUCHES\n1.000000\n13\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion correctly labeled, by NEISS product type\n\n\nPerhaps more importantly, I want to see the specific cases where the LLM is consistently getting it wrong. The following code produces all of the misses, and groups up the results by the NEISS label and the LLM label. This way I can quickly see what the LLM thought it was, versus what it really was.\n\n\nCode\nllm_output_dataframe[llm_output_dataframe['label'] == False].groupby(['Product_1', 'product_title_1', 'llm_product_code', 'llm_product']).agg(\n    label_mean=('label', 'mean'),\n    label_count=('label', 'count')\n).sort_values('label_count', ascending=False).head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlabel_mean\nlabel_count\n\n\nProduct_1\nproduct_title_1\nllm_product_code\nllm_product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n611\nBathtubs or showers (including fixtures or accessories\n610\nNONGLASS BATHTUB OR SHOWER ENCLOSURES\n0.0\n7\n\n\n1616\nJewelry (excluding watches)\n1617\nEAR PROTECTION DEVICES\n0.0\n4\n\n\n1112\nMetal containers (excluding aerosols, trash and gasoline cans)\n453\nCAN OPENERS, NOT SPECIFIED\n0.0\n3\n\n\n1616\nJewelry (excluding watches)\n1643\nKEYS, KEY RINGS OR KEY CHAINS\n0.0\n3\n\n\n4074\nChairs, other or not specified\n667\nCHAIR, RECLINER\n0.0\n3\n\n\n6670\nCHAIR, RECLINER\n0.0\n3\n\n\n836\nKnives with replaceable blades\n464\nKNIVES, NOT ELSEWHERE CLASSIFIED\n0.0\n3\n\n\n1884\nCeilings and walls (interior part of completed structure)\n1893\nDOORS, OTHER OR NOT SPECIFIED\n0.0\n3\n\n\n1807\nFloors or flooring materials\n676\nRUGS OR CARPETS, NOT SPECIFIED\n0.0\n2\n\n\n4074\nCHAIRS, OTHER OR NOT SPECIFIED\n0.0\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nIncorrectly labeled products, NEISS vs LLM\n\n\nOne of the first big sets of misses here is related to 611 - BATHTUBS OR SHOWERS. Here the LLM missed 7 times by incorrectly labeling the product 610 - 'NONGLASS BATHTUB OR SHOWER ENCLOSURES'. This one, in my opinion, is really just an artifact of some rules coding in the manual. Personally, I don’t see an easy way to distinguish the two - unless we assume that the “enclosures” part is just referring to the plastic partition that is often part of a shower.\nI also see some issues where the LLM picks ear protection devices instead of jewelry, metal containers instead of can openers, and recliner chairs instead of “other or not specified” chairs. An interesting issue crops up where the LLM labels 836 KNIVES WITH REPLACEABLE BLADES as just 464 - KNIVES, NOT ELSEWHERE CLASSIFIED. Reading through the narratives the former generally refers to things like box cutters, while the latter is typically any sort of knife (e.g. kitchen knife). There’s also some evidence of hallucinations, like where the LLM is labeling 6670  CHAIR, RECLINER instead of 667 CHAIR, RECLINER."

    "title": "An Outsider’s Perspective On Media Mix Modelling",
    "section": "The Adstock Function",
    "text": "The Adstock Function\nThe paper Bayesian Methods for Media Mix Modeling with Carryover and Shape Effects is a pretty clear and concise introduction to media mix modelling. This paper is a pretty good introduction into many of the issues related to MMM. One of the biggest issues is the need to transform the ad spend variables to better represent how they behave in real life. For example, we don’t necessarily expect an ad campaign to have an instantaneous lift, nor do we expect its effect to end immediately either. Hence, the need to model appropriate carryover effects.\nTo do this I’ll borrow a function Kylie Fu to calculate the weights for the delayed adstock function. The goal here is to define a function that can transform the ad spend variables to reflect our belief that they have delays of decay, delays of peak effect, and an upper maximum carryover effect. Below the function takes a vector of ad spend data and creates the transformation given the parameters lambda, theta, and L.\n\nDelayedSimpleAdstock &lt;- function(advertising, lambda, theta, L){\n  N &lt;- length(advertising)\n  weights &lt;- matrix(0, N, N)\n  for (i in 1:N){\n    for (j in 1:N){\n      k = i - j\n      if (k &lt; L && k &gt;= 0){\n        weights[i, j] = lambda ** ((k - theta) ** 2)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  \n  adstock &lt;- as.numeric(weights %*% matrix(advertising))\n  \n  return(adstock)  \n}\n\n\nSetting up an adstock transformation\nNow we can choose the parameters for the adstock transformation. Ideally, we want a transformation that captures the decay of the advertising program (lambda), its delayed peak onset (theta), and its maximum effect duration (L). With a bit of simulation we can see what each parameter does across a value of different lags. The goal here is to have a function that matches what we believe the actual effect of ad spending looks like for different media regions (e.g. TV, radio, internet). Below, we can see that increasing lambda increases the decay of the effect up, while varying theta sets the peak onset of the ad campaign to later lags. The value of L simply sets the maximum effect to a specific lag.\n\n# set up grid of params to iterate over\n\nx &lt;- c(1, rep(0, 15))\nlambda = seq(0,1, by = .1)\ntheta = seq(0,10, by = 1)\nL = seq(1,12, by = 1)\n\n\nLambdaThetaL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on a visual assesment I just chose an adstock function with a lambda of .8 (suggesting moderate decay of the initial ad effect), a theta of 2 (implying a peak onset of 2 weeks), and an L of 13 which is a rule-of-thumb that makes the maximum effect quite large.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdstock function (Lambda = .8, theta = 2, L = 13)\n\n\n\n\nThe code below applies our adstock function to each of the spend variables. For simplicity here I am making the assumption that all of the modes have similar adstock functions, but this can (and should) vary per modality based on expert prior information. We convert the daily data (which is quite noisy) to a more commonly utilized weekly format. We then limit the focus of our analysis to a 4-year time span.\n\n\nCode\n# setup weekly data\n# setup weekly data\nmmm_weekly_data &lt;-\n  mmm_raw %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(DATE, \"%m/%d/%Y\"),\n         year = year(date),\n         month = month(date),\n         week = week(date)) %&gt;%\n  select(\n    date,\n    year,\n    month,\n    week,\n    sales = `SALES ($)`,\n    spend_sms = `Advertising Expenses (SMS)`,\n    spend_news = `Advertising Expenses(Newspaper ads)`,\n    spend_radio = `Advertising Expenses(Radio)`,\n    spend_tv = `Advertising Expenses(TV)`,\n    spend_net = `Advertising Expenses(Internet)`,\n    demand = DEMAND,\n    supply = `POS/ Supply Data`,\n    price = `Unit Price ($)`\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(year %in% 2014:2017)\n\n\nweekly_spend &lt;-\n  mmm_weekly_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, month, week) %&gt;%\n  summarise(across(sales:spend_net, sum), across(demand:price, mean), .groups = 'drop') %&gt;%\n  mutate(index = 1:nrow(.))\n\n\n# Apply transformation to advertising variables, scale dollar values to per $1,000\nX &lt;-\n  weekly_spend %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(spend_sms:spend_net,~ DelayedSimpleAdstock(.,lambda = .8,theta = 2,L = 13)),\n         across(spend_sms:price, function(x) x/1e3),\n         trend = 1:nrow(.)/nrow(.))\n\n\n\n\nSetting up the model\nBefore we fit the model we can plot out the primary variables of interest, along with our dependent variable sales. Looking below we can see a few potential issues. One which should jump out immediately is that there is a very high correlation between several of our ad spend categories. For example, the correlation between TV spending and news spending is almost 1. In the case of MMM this is a common problem, which makes unique identification of the effect of ad spends much more difficult. More troubling, by just eyeballing these plots there doesn’t seem to be a terribly strong relationship between any of the advertising venues and sales.\n\nplot(X[, c('sales',\n           'spend_sms',\n           'spend_news',\n           'spend_radio',\n           'spend_tv',\n           'spend_net')], col = '#004488')\n\n\n\n\nPairwise relationships between sales ~ ad venues\n\n\n\n\nNor do the pairwise correlations seem to be very high either (in fact, they are very nearly zero).

    "section": "Fitting A Model",
    "text": "Fitting A Model\nOne of the biggest challenges with MMM is that many of the model coefficients including the advertising venues, are likely to be very highly correlated. For example, the advertising spend on TV ads is almost perfectly correlated with the spend on news ads. We can set some moderately strong priors on the ad spend coefficients to ensure that the estimates don’t explode due to multicollinearity. Here I’m just placing a normal(0, .5) prior which is still pretty wide for a coefficient on the logrithmic scale.\n\n\nCode\n# set up priors\nbprior &lt;- c(prior(normal(0,.5), class = \"b\", coef = \"spend_sms\"),\n            prior(normal(0,.5), class = \"b\", coef = \"spend_news\"),\n            prior(normal(0,.5), class = \"b\", coef = \"spend_radio\"),\n            prior(normal(0,.5), class = \"b\", coef = \"spend_tv\"),\n            prior(normal(0,.5), class = \"b\", coef = \"spend_net\"))\n\n# just intercept\nbrm_fit_0 &lt;- brm(log(sales) ~ 1, data = X,\n                 chains = 4,\n                 cores = 4,\n                 family = gaussian(),\n                 file = \"C:/Users/gioc4/Documents/blog/data/brms_models/mmm_fit0.Rdata\")\n\n# no random effects, linear trend effect\nbrm_fit_1 &lt;- brm(log(sales) ~                 \n                   demand +\n                   supply +\n                   price +\n                   as.factor(month) +\n                   as.factor(week) +\n                   trend +\n                   spend_sms +\n                   spend_news +\n                   spend_radio +\n                   spend_tv +\n                   spend_net,\n                 data = X,\n                 chains = 4,\n                 cores = 4,\n                 prior = bprior,\n                 family = gaussian(),\n                 file = \"C:/Users/gioc4/Documents/blog/data/brms_models/mmm_fit1.Rdata\")\n\n# random effects for month+week\n# smoothing spline for trend\nbrm_fit_2 &lt;- brm(log(sales) ~                 \n                   demand +\n                   supply +\n                   price +\n                   s(trend) +\n                   spend_sms +\n                   spend_news +\n                   spend_radio +\n                   spend_tv +\n                   spend_net +\n                   (1|month) +\n                   (1|week),\n                 data = X,\n                 chains = 4,\n                 cores = 4,\n                 prior = bprior,\n                 family = gaussian(),\n                 control = list(adapt_delta = .9),\n                 file = \"C:/Users/gioc4/Documents/blog/data/brms_models/mmm_fit2.Rdata\")\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation\nNow we can evaluate the models. Here, I evaluate a model with random effects for month and week, and a smoothing spline for the trend component against a fixed effects model with a linear trend, and a “null” model with just an intercept. The model with a smooth trend spline appears to beat out the linear trend, which makes sense given the non-linear bump in sales observed in the raw data.\n\n\nCode\n# evaluate models using leave-out-out criterion\n# looks like smoothing spline is slightly better\nloo_eval &lt;- loo(brm_fit_0, brm_fit_1, brm_fit_2)\n\n\nWarning: Found 12 observations with a pareto_k &gt; 0.7 in model 'brm_fit_1'. We\nrecommend to set 'moment_match = TRUE' in order to perform moment matching for\nproblematic observations.\n\n\nWarning: Found 15 observations with a pareto_k &gt; 0.7 in model 'brm_fit_2'.

In Bayesian terms what this means is we take a sample of draws from our fitted model and compare them against the observed data. If our model is capturing the process well, the predicted values should generally follow the observed process. Below we see that our model does a fairly decent job.\n\n\nCode\npp_check(brm_fit_2)\n\n\nUsing 10 posterior draws for ppc type 'dens_overlay' by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior predictive check, smoothing spline model\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can look at some of the model coefficients\n\nsummary(brm_fit_2)\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: log(sales) ~ demand + supply + price + s(trend) + spend_sms + spend_news + spend_radio + spend_tv + spend_net + (1 | month) + (1 | week) \n   Data: X (Number of observations: 197) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nSmoothing Spline Hyperparameters:\n              Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsds(strend_1)     1.53      0.73     0.54     3.35 1.00     1739     2509\n\nMultilevel Hyperparameters:\n~month (Number of levels: 12) \n              Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsd(Intercept)     0.86      0.22     0.55     1.38 1.00     1413     2226\n\n~week (Number of levels: 53) \n              Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsd(Intercept)     0.79      0.09     0.64     1.00 1.00      721     1142\n\nRegression Coefficients:\n            Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept      13.88      0.48    12.94    14.83 1.00     2447     3039\ndemand          0.01      0.03    -0.06     0.07 1.00     4078     3029\nsupply          0.19      0.04     0.12     0.26 1.00     4860     3017\nprice           2.88      0.99     0.83     4.86 1.00     4064     2908\nspend_sms       0.12      0.17    -0.22     0.45 1.00     5927     3202\nspend_news     -0.01      0.51    -1.01     0.99 1.00     6425     2879\nspend_radio     0.18      0.14    -0.10     0.46 1.00     4534     2610\nspend_tv       -0.02      0.02    -0.05     0.01 1.00     5170     2835\nspend_net       0.00      0.00    -0.00     0.01 1.00     4820     3243\nstrend_1       -2.42      1.55    -5.84     0.34 1.00     2711     2636\n\nFurther Distributional Parameters:\n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma     0.15      0.01     0.13     0.17 1.00     1381     2410\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

Most applied uses of MMM apply some optimization algorithms to determine the best ad spend mix given a fixed budget. The data I have here isn’t really good enough to delve any deeper into - but its important to note that fitting the model is really only the beginning."

    "text": "In Closing: My Take\nMy biggest problem with Mixed Media Modelling is that it seems like it is easy to implement badly, but much harder to do well. Not only do you have to appropriately model an adstock function for your advertising venues, you also have very high correlation between your variables. This, in turn, makes the choice of model specification even more important because the coefficients with be highly sensitive. Personally, a true experiment or even quasi-experiment would be preferable to this - although I’m all too aware that this is often impossible. Like everything there is no magic bullet, and choosing one approach over another will always introduce trade offs."

The actual LLM component was pretty simple. I set up a role laying out the rules of how to pick, then populated the prompt with a detailed selection about my wine preferences.

Next, review this list of wines available for sale:\n        {wines_list}\n\n        3. Based on the preferences listed in step 1, suggest a MAXIMUM of 5 wines to purchase.\n            - ONLY choose from the wines that are available for sale under step 2\n            - If a producer has more than 1 wine present, ONLY CHOOSE UP TO 2 of their wines\n            - If a wine is present that matches the \"Highest Priority Wines\" section, you MUST include it\n            - You may make suggestions for wines that are not present in the \"Producer Preferences\" section\n            - If no wines are a close match, make your best effort to suggest AT LEAST one wine that matches preferences\n\n        4.

Finally, I tell it to give me results as a object parseable as JSON so I can quickly unpack it.\n\n\nThe main workflow\nI know generally when the emails come in. They always during weekdays, and typically during a certain 30 minute period of the late morning. I use the Windows scheduler to execute the code via a .bat file at a specific hour of the morning when I know the emails typically come in. This just activates the code in main, which continually scans my inbox for the email for the next ten minutes or so. If it’s found, then the rest of the process kicks off.\nThe function export_shop_link() simply looks for an email from the retailer containing a specific subject line. The next step of the process opens the email up, goes to the specific link that leads to the shop, and scrapes the listings into a list of dicts. These get passed directly into the prompt, which the LLM then uses to make a suggestion. It also passes along the exact hyperlinks in the output which is sent back to my email with a text notification.\n\nCARRIER_GATEWAY = \"vtext.com\"\nTO_PHONE_NUMBER = json.loads(os.getenv('TO_PHONE_NUMBER', '[]'))\nTO_EMAIL = json.loads(os.getenv(\"TO_EMAIL\", \"[]\"))\nFROM_EMAIL = os.getenv(\"FROM_EMAIL\")\nGMAIL_PASS = os.getenv(\"GMAIL_AUTH_TOKEN\")\n\nTOTAL_TIME_DURATION_MINUTES = 15 \nTIME_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 60\nTIME_DURATION_SECONDS = TOTAL_TIME_DURATION_MINUTES*60\nTIME_BEGIN = datetime.now()\nTIME_END = TIME_BEGIN + timedelta(seconds=TIME_DURATION_SECONDS)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    logging.info(\"Starting wine suggestion monitor...\")\n    # logic:\n    # daily, at 11:20 AM, main.py is triggered by scheduler\n    # main then continues to scan at 1 min intervals until:\n        # time runs out (~15 minutes) = END\n        # a valid email is found = END\n\n    while datetime.now() &lt; TIME_END:\n        link = export_shop_link()\n\n        # run if a valid link is found\n        if link:\n            logging.info(f\"Found a valid link: {link}\")\n            listed_wines = scrape_wines_from_page(link)\n\n            suggestions_json = suggest_wines(listed_wines)\n            suggestions = json.loads(suggestions_json)\n\n            email_body = format_email(suggestions)\n\n            # push notifications\n            for to_person in TO_EMAIL:\n                send_email(\"Your Wine Picks 🍷\", email_body, to_person, FROM_EMAIL, GMAIL_PASS)\n\n            for to_number in TO_PHONE_NUMBER:\n                send_sms_via_email(to_number, CARRIER_GATEWAY, FROM_EMAIL, GMAIL_PASS)\n\n            logging.info(f\"Suggestions: {suggestions}\")\n            break\n        else:\n            logging.info(\"No emails found.\")\n            time.sleep(TIME_INTERVAL_SECONDS)\n            \nlogging.info(\"Wine monitor script ended.\")\n\nThe result is a text message to my phone, and a link to my inbox with the AI’s best guess picks. Here was an example I generated during testing. The following was actually a pretty good set of selections.

    "section": "The Solution",
    "text": "The Solution\nMy solution was to write up some code to do a few things. First, I needed to know when the emails arrived to my inbox within a very short period of time. Second, I needed to then follow the link to the sales page and get the full listing of wines for sale. Finally, I needed to identify ONLY the wines I would be interested in buying and send them to my phone or email so I could quickly review them. I wrote up some code to do this using the Google gmail API for the email monitoring, and a separate script to pull all the listings from the sales page.\nIf you want to review the whole codebase, I have it up on my personal github page here. The most important parts are:\n\nScan my personal gmail account for the sales email\nScrape the listings off the sales page\nEmail and text me back purchase recommendations\n\nThe last thing I needed to decide on was how to get only the most relevant recommendations to myself quickly.\n\nAnd a Bit More About the Bot\nI initially thought that I could just write up a config file containing all the names of wines and producers that I wanted to buy, and then check for their presence in the scraped listings using regex. However, with virtually little extra effort I figured I could use an LLM to identify whether the wines I wanted were present AND provide some recommendations if the exact ones were not present. My idea was to write a prompt that would contain all my preferences, then give a series of rules on how to evaluate whether to recommend something to me or not. The end goal here is that I wanted to end up with a tightly curated list of things to buy that were either: (1) an exact producer I wanted to buy or (2) something very similar that I would probably like.\nFor the AI component I wrote up a short prompt. The task I gave the LLM was to review a full list of wines for sale in the link from the email (about 70 to 80 wines total), identify the top 5 most relevant based on my stated preferences, and send me a text and email with direct links to buy them. Implementing the actual LLM component was simple compared to all the web scraping stuff. I defined a system role laying out broad the rules of how to pick wines, then populated the body of the prompt with a detailed selection about my wine preferences. (Incidentally, if you want to buy me a good Christmas gift, feel free to closely peruse the list below). To give the LLM more context on things that I like I first defined some broad categories (countries, regions, and grape varietals), then more specific ones (producers).\n\n\nWine recommending prompt\n\n\nCode\nROLE = \"\"\"You are a wine expert.

First, review this list of preferences:\n\n        ## Region Preferences\n        - (France): Jura, Champagne, Burgandy, Loire, Alsace, Savoie\n        - (United States): California, Willamette Valley\n        - (Spain): Andalucia, Canary Islands\n        - (Portugal): Dão, Maideria\n        - (Germany): Mosel, Baden\n\n        ## Grape Preferences\n        - Chardonnay, Savignin, Aligote, Chenin Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Noir, Trousseau, Poulsard\n\n        ## Producer Preferences\n        - France:\n            * (Jura): Ganevat, Tissot, Gahier, Labet, Marnes Blanches, Chatillon, Les Bottes Rouges, Tony Bornard, Domaine de Saint Pierre, Nicolas Jacob\n            * (Champagne): Marguet, Laherte Frères, Georges Laval, Suenen\n            * (Burgandy): DeMoor, Sylvain Pataille\n            * (Savoie): Camille et Mathieu Apffel, Jean-Yves Péron, Belluard, Domaine du Gringet\n            * (Loire): Chateau Yvvone, Jean-Pierre Robinot\n        - United States:\n            * (California): Arnot-Roberts, Ridge, Outward, Scar of the Sea, Iruai, Pax Mahle\n            * (Willamette Valley): Martin Woods, Ken Wright, Kelley Fox\n        - Spain:\n            * López de Heredia\n            * Cota 45, Ramiro Ibáñez\n            * Commando G\n            * Envinate\n        - Portugal:\n            * João Pato\n        - Germany:\n            * (Mosel): Ulli Stein, JJ Prum, Peter Lauer, Julian Haart\n            * (Obermosel): Jonas Dostert\n            * (Rheinhessen): Keller\n            * (Saar): Hofgut Falkenstein\n            * Wasenhaus\n\n        ## Highest Priority Wines\n            - Jura Chardonnay & Savagnin (sous voile)\n            - Jura Macvin, Vin de Paille\n            - Red wines from Nicolas Jacob\n            - White or Rosé López de Heredia\n            - Large format wines (1.5L or 3L)\n\n        2. Next, review this list of wines available for sale:\n        {wines_list}\n\n        3. Based on the preferences listed in step 1, suggest a MAXIMUM of 5 wines to purchase.\n            - ONLY choose from the wines that are available for sale under step 2\n            - If a producer has more than 1 wine present, ONLY CHOOSE UP TO 2 of their wines\n            - If a wine is present that matches the \"Highest Priority Wines\" section, you MUST include it\n            - You may make suggestions for wines that are not present in the \"Producer Preferences\" section\n            - If no wines are a close match, make your best effort to suggest AT LEAST one wine that matches preferences\n\n        4. Closely follow these rules to generate your output:\n            - Provide your response as a properly formatted JSON object.\n            - You MUST include the name of the wine, the producer, and a link to the wine in the shop.\n            - You MUST respond ONLY with valid JSON, without any extra text or explanation\n            - The JSON should be a single array of objects\n            - Follow the format below EXACTLY:\n\n        ## Example Output\n\n        {{\"Wine\": \"[name of wine]\", \"Producer\": \"[producer name]\", \"URL\": \"[url]\"}}\n        \"\"\"\n\n    return prompt\n\n\nAside from the preferences in the prompt, I tell the LLM to follow some rules about not choosing all wines from a single producer, and to always recommend things that I deem “highest priority”. Finally, I tell it to give me results as a object parseable as JSON so I can quickly unpack it.\n\n\nThe main workflow\nFrom experience I know with some certainty when the emails come in: they arrive exclusively on weekdays, and during a certain 30 minute period of the late morning. I use the Windows scheduler to execute the code via a .bat file at a specific hour of the morning when I know the emails typically come in. This just activates the code in main, which continually scans my inbox for the email for the next ten minutes or so. If it’s found, then the rest of the process kicks off.\nThe function export_shop_link() simply looks for an email from the retailer containing a specific subject line.

Here is a recent example from sale that was posted only a few days ago from a private selection sale of “Exceptional French Wines”. The following image below is my bot’s highlights from the 70+ wines that were part of the sale. Overall, I would say it did very good!\n\n\n\nA selection of bot-curated selections from Jura and Savoie\n\n\nI have a lot of Jura picks on my list, which most of these are (all except the Belluard). There’s two whites, a savagnin from Ganevat and a chardonnay from Tissot, plus another Tissot red and a more obscure Poulsard from Montborgeau. I don’t have Montbourgeau explicitly listed on my preferences, but this is a great suggestion. I love Poulsard and I really like the wines from this producer. All five of these wines would be something that I would want to buy, and I got the recs pushed directly to my phone within a minute of the email hitting my inbox!"
